      "body": "Ghaziabad: In a horrific incident of dog attack that occurred last week, an 11-year-old boy was mauled by a pitbull, leaving the child scarred in the face, probably for life. The victim got some 150 stiches and remained in a hospital for three days, said reports.  The incident occurred in a park where the victim was playing and so was the dog with its owner, on September 3. However, the incident hogged headlines only on Thursday when a CCTV footage of the incident surfaced on the internet. The video shows the dog ran with the leash and attacked the kid.   Bystanders rescued the boy from dog’s clutches but it had already severely bitten the boy across his face. So much so, that paramedics had to give the victim over 100 stiches across the left side of the face till the ears.  Reports said the victim remained hospitalised for three days.  The incident invited angry reactions and outrage from residents of the area. Some of them demanded dog-owners to tape their pets’ mouth before bringing them to public spaces. “We must make some amends now in order to save our kids, they roam around like monnsters because we do not tape their mouth,” a resident tweeted.  The video got attention of the authorities. While the municipal corporation slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on the dog owner, Subhash Tyagi of Ghaziabad, for keeping the dog without license or registration.  Cops from Madhuban Bapudham Police Station, however, said they had not received any complaint. “Action will be taken if a complaint is filed,” Ghaziabad police tweeted.

The pleas will be heard by the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) UU Lalit and comprising Justice S Ravindra Bhatt.  The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, was notified on 12 December, 2019, and it came into force on January 10, 2020. It aims to give citizenship to migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan,  CAA evoked widespread protests across the country as it was perceived as an attempt to deprive Muslims of Indian citizenship.  For the unversed, in January 2020, the apex court had issued notice over the batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the CAA.  In December 2019, the top court bench comprising the then CJI Sharad A. Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant had asked the Centre to file a response by the second week of January. The court had said the CAA, 2019, is “uppermost in everybody’s minds”, but refused to stay the law without hearing the government first.  The petitions before the Supreme Court stated that the Act which liberalises and fast-tracks the grant of citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan “promotes religion-based discrimination”.  After this, the apex court in January 2020 granted four weeks time to the Central government to respond to the petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the CAA.  “CAA is a specific amendment which seeks to tackle a specific problem prevalent in the specified countries i.e. persecution on the ground of religion in light of the undisputable theocratic constitutional position in the specified countries..:, the government’s affidavit said.  It further clarified that the CAA does not impinge upon any existing right that may have existed prior to the enactment of the amendment and further, in no manner whatsoever, seeks to affect the legal, democratic or secular rights of any of the Indian citizens.

      "body": "Washington: A man killed at least four people and wounded three others in an hours-long shooting rampage across Memphis on Wednesday, before a high-speed chase that ended with his arrest, police in the city said.  Officers identified the suspect as Ezekiel Kelly, 19, and said he was apprehended with two weapons in his vehicle at approximately 9:00 pm local time.  “[Kelly] was taken into custody without incident by the Memphis police department and the Shelby County sheriff’s office,” said Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis at a news conference.  Kelly is alleged to have killed his first victim just after midnight on Wednesday, and gone on a shooting spree across the Tennessee city in the afternoon and early evening, Davis said.  There were at least eight different crime scenes, police said, including car-jackings and a shooting at a local store, and Kelly had live-streamed parts of his spree.  “Ezekiel Kelly was on Facebook Live when he opened fire inside the store,” said Davis.  Authorities issued a “shelter in place” order while the shootings were ongoing, effectively locking down parts of the city.  The United States regularly sees mass shootings and other gun violence, but Congress has been reluctant to pass strict gun control legislation as the issue remains politically divisive.  At least 490 people have been killed in mass shootings and mass murders in the US in 2022 so far, according to the Gun Violence Archive, with 14,050 people dying in gun-related incidents over the same period, excluding suicides.  Memphis has seen a string of high-profile killings in recent months, including the murder of a pastor during a carjacking and the abduction and murder last week of a woman who was on a pre-dawn run.  “I am angry. I am angry for [the victims] and I’m angry for our citizens who had to shelter in place for their own safety until this suspect was caught,” said Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland following Wednesday’s shootings.  “This is no way for us to live, and it is not acceptable,” said the Mayor.

      "body": "New Delhi: All eyes are on the much-awaited inauguration of the “Kartavya Path”, previously known as Rajpath and the unveiling of a statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at the India Gate, but politics over the event is gaining momentum where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee declined the invitation for the event saying that it was “not proper”.  Banerjee said that she received a letter on Wednesday from a bureaucrat informing about the unveiling of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose statue at the ‘Kartavya Path’ by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today.  “I received a letter yesterday from a undersecretary saying the Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Netaji statue at 7 pm and you must be there at 6 pm. As if I am their boned labour. How can an undersecretary write to a Chief Minister? Why has the culture minister become so big,” the West Bengal chief minister said at a party gathering in Kolkata.  She further said, “That’s why I garlanded the Netaji statue here in the afternoon today to offer my respects.”  BJP Co-incharge West Bengal Amit Malviya hit back at Banerjee and accused her for doing “nothing” to honour the legacy of Netaji. “Now that Prime Minister has taken the historic decision, she is making puerile attempts to sully the solemn occasion,” he added.   Malviya further said that the West Bengal chief minister is \"feeling bad\" that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's statue is being installed in the heart of Delhi.  Kartavya Path is a stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and will be like a green pathway with red granite walkways, state-wise food stalls, new amenity blocks, refurbished canals.  The event will commence at 7:00 pm on Thursday (8 September) when the Prime Minister will unveil a 28-foot statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose near India Gate and inaugurate the refurbished Central Vista avenue.  Banerjee also attacked the Centre for not being invited to meet the visiting Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is on a four-day India tour.  \"I share a very good relationship with Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, but the Centre did not invite me to be part of her official visit to India,\" she said.  Banerjee further claimed that it was for the first time that the Bangladesh PM is in India and Bengal has been left out. \"I heard Hasina ji wanted to meet me. I have very good relations with her family,\" she remarked.  With inputs from agencies  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

He has betrayed the party. OPS is like a chameleon,” said Palaniswami.   Palaniswami, popularly known as EPS, returned to the party headquarters today for the first time after his position as the single, supreme leader of AIADMK was strengthened by the Madras High Court order.   In a show of strength, hundreds of party workers, and elected MLAs and MPs gave Palaniswami a rousing reception as he paid tributes to the statues of the former Tamil Nadu chief ministers, MG Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa.  “Elections will be held soon for the post of party’s general secretary. Today, we entered the party headquarters and paid our respects to party leaders late MGR and late J Jayalalithaa,” he said.   On the party leadership dispute, the Madras High Court had on 2 September, allowed Palaniswami’s appeal and set aside an earlier order in favour of Panneerselvam.  A division bench comprising Justice M Duraiswamy and Justice Sundar Mohan set aside an order of a single judge, which nullified the 11 July General Council meeting of the AIADMK.  In that meeting held in July, leader of opposition EPS was elected as the interim general secretary of the party, the top post. Panneerselvam was ousted from the party.  O Panneerselvam, meanwhile, said the High Court verdict would be challenged in the Supreme Court.

Entering the Electronic Vehicle (EV) space as a new rival in town, the Mahindra all-electric XUV400 is expected to launch on 8 September, 2022, as per the reports.  The all-electric SUV will be based on the eXUV300 that was introduced by the manufacturer during the 2020 Auto Expo.  Although, the all-electric XUV400 is inspired by the eXUV300, hordes of modifications are expected to feature on the new Mahindra electric SUV.  Since the lower tax bracket policy does not apply to electric vehicles, the Mahindra XUV400 electric is expected to be roughly 4.3 metres in length, almost trumping the sub-4-metre rule.  Several other cosmetic aspects, including a closed front grille, integrated DRLs, and a reprofiled rear, will also help the EV stand out of its competitors.  Not much is revealed about the powerhouse of the vehicle but the Mahindra XUV400 might hone high-density NMC (Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt) cells which offer an extended driving range.  NMC Cells are a very popular option for solar storage equipment. With the use of the NMC cells, one can expect a range of 350-400 kilometres from the Mahindra XUV400.  This gives an edge to the Mahindra EV when compared to one of the biggest rivals in the market, the Tata Nexon EV, which offers a range of 312 kilometres. As per a report by Financial Express, the Mahindra XUV400 will be powered by a single motor, capable of churning out a maximum power of 150 bhp.  With the launch of the XUV400, Mahindra will kickstart the Mahindra Born Electric SUV campaign, which was unveiled on August. The vehicles under the concept will be designed at the Mahindra Advanced Design Europe (MADE) studio located in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom.  Coming to the price of the MahindraXUV400, the EV Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV) is expected to fall in the range of Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. The car will compete with the likes of Tata Nexon and MG ZS EV.  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

While the audience is also eagerly waiting to witness a blast of entertainment from Bollywood, there weren’t many films that stood strong on their expectation. If we look at the films that have actually brought a fair return on investment on their budget would be Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri’s directorial The Kashmir Files and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 starring Kartik Aaryan. These two films are the only films that not only proved profitable for the producers but also brought back the lost charm of the theatres.  If we take a close look into its investment and return on it, The Kashmir Files were made on a budget of around 25 Cr. but collected around 340 Cr. at the global box office window. On the other hand, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 is another film that was made on a budget of around 70 Cr. but collected a huge figure of around 266 Cr. worldwide. This has certainly seen that the best and the smart investment anyone can make is on good content and which has been proved with these films excelling at the box office while side-lining all the big films with big budgets.

It is agenda driven and makes more noise than reality and creates a hype around Bollywood and may not necessarily mirror the real people’s feelings for the industry. It is just a narrative that is being built to malign Bollywood. Nobody really hates Bollywood.  The attack it there, but trade experts believe that this #BoycottBollywood movement is not actually affecting business. A boycott campaign cannot cause a film to flop. It can have an effect, but it can’t stop cinema lovers to watch their favorite stars. The trollers are talking about how badly Laal Singh Chaddha and Raksha Bandhan did at the box office. Isn’t it time to also talk about the Bollywood box office hits this year like Gangubai Kathiawadi, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Jugjugg Jeeyo and Ek Villain Returns.  Buck up Bollywood we know you can do it Laal Singh Chaddha and Raksha Bandhan  Since the last few years Twitter truly has become powerful to the extent they are trying to break the careers of Bollywood actors and it has become a playground for fights, trolls, calling out people and all things distasteful. Recently as per reports, Vijay Deverakonda, who plays the protagonist in the film Liger, hit back at the trend and said, “Shouldn’t we work? We have worked hard for three years to make this cinema. Shouldn’t we release our movies? Should we sit in homes?”  Buck up Bollywood we know you can do it Liger star Vijay Devakoranda faced boycott calls for speaking up against targeting Hindi films  The year 2022, with theatres opening and the pandemic officially over, we thought Bollywood will go back to its pre pandemic glorious days.  The hate for Bollywood and the love for Sushant Sight Rajput was so high that SSR’s death brought about the systematic end of many of our favourite stars. Especially the most powerful Khans in the industry were attacked like never before. In spite of the harsh #BoycottBollywood trend which is getting harsher every day, we still have hope that Bollywood will soon regain its past glory.  According to media reports actor Suniel Shetty broke his silence on the ongoing social media boycott trends and why #BoycottBollywood have had an impact on some of the recently released films. During the event, he answered several questions asked by the media. During the event, speaking about the boycott trend he said, “We have done a lot of good work too. However, people might not be happy with the type of subjects the films are having these days, and that is why we are going through such a tough time. Hopefully, this will be considered. Initially, it felt like a one-off thing but now we have been continuously seeing that people are not coming to theatres and I can’t put my finger on a reason why and what this is happening.’’  (With added inputs from agencies)",

      "body": "New Delhi: India launched its first indigenously designed and built aircraft carrier INS Vikrant on Friday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi commissioning it. With the induction of this mighty warship, India has joined a select club of nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China and France which have the capability to build its own aircraft carrier.  But there are several other facts, which make this aircraft carrier not only special but also the pride of the new Atmanirbhar Bharat.  India’s first indigenously designed and built aircraft carrier  About 90 per cent of the hull, 50 per cent of the machinery and 30 per cent of weapons and sensors of INS Vikrant are indigenously designed and built. It has been designed by Indian Navy’s in-house Warship Design Bureau (WDB) and built by Cochin Shipyard Limited, a public sector shipyard under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways. Vikrant has been built with state-of-the-art automation features and is the largest ship ever built in maritime history of India.  Cochin Shipyard’s largest warship ever built  The yard commenced the shipbuilding operations in 1978, ship repair in 1981, marine engineering training in 1993 and offshore upgradation in 1999. It has facilities to build vessels up to 1.1 lakh tons and repair vessels up to 1.25 lakh tons, the largest such facilities in India. The 262 m long and 62 m wide INS Vikrant displaces approximately 45,000 tons when fully loaded.  21,500 tonnes of special grade steel developed indigenously  According to the Centre, over 76 per cent of the material and equipment on board IAC-1 is indigenous, including “21,500 tonnes of special grade steel developed indigenously and used in Indian Naval Ships for the first time”.  According to the official release, major Indian industrial houses, including BEL, BHEL, GRSE, Keltron, Kirloskar, L&T, Wartsila India, and over 100 MSMEs, contributed to the development of indigenous equipment and machinery on board.  Job creation  According to a government statement, the indigenisation efforts resulted in the development of ancillary industries and the creation of employment opportunities for 2,000 CSL personnel and approximately 13,000 employees in ancillary industries, thereby bolstering the plough-back effect on the nation’s economy. The navy previously stated that more than 50 Indian manufacturers were directly involved in the project and that approximately 2,000 Indians were directly employed on board IAC-1 daily. Over 40,000 people were indirectly employed.  Produced from 3D model  The Union Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways has said that CSL “carried out the detailed engineering of the ship using advanced software which enabled the designer to get a complete 3D view of the compartments of the ship”, representing the “first time in the country that a ship of the size of an aircraft carrier is completely modeled in 3D and production drawings extracted from the 3D model”, reports CNN-News18.

      "body": "New Delhi: Ghulam Nabi Azad announced the launch of his own political party while addressing a public meeting in Jammu on Sunday at Sainik Colony. He is yet to decide on the name of the party.  This was Azad’s first meeting since he ended his nearly 50-year association with the Congress on 26 August.  “The people of Jammu and Kashmir will decide the name and the flag for the party. I will give a Hindustani name to my party that everyone can understand,” said Azad.  He added that his party will focus on the restoration of full statehood, right to land and employment to native domicile.  According to Hindustan Times, Azad arrived at the venue after a rousing welcome from his supporters at Jammu airport. The former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir wore a Dogra turban befitting the occasion.  “I am always with the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Right now, I am not the chief minister or any minister. I am just a human. In the past one week, many people have resigned from the Congress and have supported me,” Azad said during his address.  Azad also thanked those five ministers who joined him. “Three of them joined a regional party, I never named that regional party chief, but they got agitated when I spoke of floating my own party,” Azad added.  Former ministers Taj Mohiuddin, Abdul Majid Wani, Manohar Lal Sharma, GM Saroori, RS Chin, Jugal Kishore, Peerzada Mohd Sayeed, and former MLA Balwan Singh, who were present at the event, endorsed Azad for the position of Jammu and Kashmir’s next chief minister.  During his address he also launched an attack on the grand-old party. According to ANI, he said, “Congress was made by us, by our blood, not by computers, not by twitter. People are trying to defame us but their reach is limited to computers and tweets. That is the reason Congress is nowhere to be seen on the ground.”  “People from Congress now go to jail in buses, they call DGP, commissioners, get their name written and leave within an hour. That is the reason Congress has been unable to grow,” he added.  Azad had earlier targeted the party leadership, particularly Rahul Gandhi, in his resignation letter to Sonia Gandhi, for the way the party has been run over the last nearly nine years.  He claimed in the five-page letter that the party is run by a coterie, with Sonia Gandhi serving as “a nominal head” and all major decisions being made by “Rahul Gandhi or, worse, his security guards and PAs.”  In recounting his long association with the Congress, Azad stated that the party’s situation has reached a “point of no return.”  With input from agencies  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

      "body": "Ahmedabad: External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said talking about the Indian Ocean and not the Pacific Ocean when discussing India’s maritime interest shows a limitation of thinking, and India should go beyond this historical line of thinking.  “Indo-Pacific is a new strategic concept going on in the world,” he said on Sunday.  Dogma should change  The idea that India should not interfere with the issues of other countries is a kind of “dogma” which should change, Jaishankar said at a function to unveil the Gujarati translation of his book, “The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World.”  Being the fifth largest economy, India should display confidence, “which is lacking because of our habits that keep us tied up”, he said.  He also said that “engage America, manage China, cultivate Europe, reassure Russia, bring in Japan..is the ‘Sabka Saath and Sabka Vishwas’ in India’s foreign policy”.  “So far, we think about the Indian Ocean whenever we think about oceans. This is the limitation of our thinking that we talk about the Indian Ocean whenever we talk about maritime interest,” Jaishankar said.  “But more than 50 per cent of our trade goes towards the East, towards the Pacific Ocean. The line between the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean is only on the map, exists on an atlas, but there is no such thing in reality…We should go beyond the historical lines in our thinking, because our interest has increased. Indo-Pacific is a new strategic concept going on in the world,” he said.  Talking about a chapter in his book, the minister said the fact that we should not interfere in the problems of others in the world is a kind of “dogma.”  “It is possible that we did not have the capacity and it was not in our interest in the 1950s and 1960s, but some days back we became the fifth largest economy. The thinking of someone on the 20th number and 5th number cannot be the same. We should change according to our capacity. The confidence that we should display is not there, and it is not so because our habits keep us tied up,” he said.  ‘Sabka Saath and Sabka Vishwas’ in Indian foreign policy  He also quoted a line from his book which says “Engage America, manage China, cultivate Europe, reassure Russia, bring in Japan,”, and said that “this is ‘Sabka Saath and Sabka Vishwas’ in Indian foreign policy.”  “We have reached that level where we should maintain relations with everyone as much as we can to take forward our own interest because India’s progress in a way becomes a criterion for us. We have reached that level where we should keep our own interest with everyone to move forward,” he said.  Jaishankar also focused on the importance of getting a feedback from the public when determining a policy.  “Sometimes we should also think in which direction the public is going. It should not happen that a policy is going in one direction, and the public in another direction. The connection between the public and government — how to take the feedback. Feedback is important for good governance,” he said.  “For policy also there is a need to take feedback, and this is possible when we can connect with the masses,” he said.  About China  Talking about China, Jaishankar said it is India’s “super neighbour” and there is a lesson to learn from its progress and its impact on India and its interests.  “China is our neighbour, and in a way our super neighbour. It is the biggest neighbour, when you look at its power, its economy, where it has reached, its development. We also have to see if there is a lesson for us in its progress, and its impact on us, on our interest, its influence on our other neighbours,” he said.  “China’s economy is more than four times our own. I believe that our thinking should be competitive rather than negative,” he said.  There is also a need to think more about Japan, he said.  Three factors that hurt India  Jaishankar said in the last 75 years, India has been hurt by partition, delay in carrying out economic reforms, and a gap between the two nuclear tests.  “These three factors are in a way for us something whose impact is seen now. How do we go ahead keeping them in mind is a big part of our strategy,” he said. He also dwelled on the lessons that the epic Mahabharat has on diplomacy.  “There is no better story with so many examples, dilemmas…there is no better story than this in the world… If we do not talk about ourselves, then how will the world talk about us. The current situation of the world and the then landscape of Mahabharat, the situation of India, somewhere I saw a similarity,” he said.

      "body": "New Delhi: A video clip of Rahul Gandhi from the ‘Halla Bol’ rally has gone viral where he can be heard goofing up the unit for “flour”. In the viral clip, Gandhi is saying, “Atta (flour) was Rs 22 per litre but today it is Rs 40 per litre”.   Rahul Gandhi began comparing the prices of a few essential commodities with their prices in 2014. Gandhi was listing out the prices of various commodities whose units were mostly in litres and he goofed up while calling out the unit price for flour.  “Halla bol” rally  Congress was holding a mega rally 'Mehangai Par Halla Bol' today against inflation in the country, unemployment and Goods and Services Tax hike at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital.  Rahul Gandhi came down heavily on the Narendra Modi-led Central government and said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) are dividing the country and a sense of fear has engulfed the minds of people about \" their future, inflation and unemployment and that's turning them towards hate.\"  \"Hatred is rising in India. Fear of inflation and unemployment is increasing in India, and due to this hatred is rising. BJP and RSS dividing the country and creating fear in the country. Who gets the benefit of this fear? Is it poor, farmer, or small traders who are getting any benefit from the Narendra Modi government? Only two industrialists in the country benefitting from this fear and hatred,\" said Congress MP.  He further said that the Modi government's policies are benefitting only two big industrialists.  \"BJP giving all the benefits to two people. Now see Narendra Modi did demonetisation. Did it help the poor? The three farm laws that were withdrawn later by the govt were not for farmers but it was for those two industrialists only. But the farmers came on the road and showed their power to Narendra Modi and when PM Modi saw this, he had to take back the three farm laws,\" he said.  The Congress leader further said that the Modi government broke the backbone of small and medium enterprises.  \"In one way, you are being affected by unemployment and secondly, you are hit by the price rise. Narendra Modi asks what has Congress done in seventy years. I will say this, that in seventy years, Congress has not shown such price rise to the country and when the Opposition wants to raise the issue in Parliament then Narendra Modi's government doesn't allow it. Whether it is farmers' issue or China,\" he added.  Making the attack more aggressive, the Congress MP said, \"The media is also of these two industrialists, the whole of media is under those two businessmen. People know whose TV it is and whom they are working for. TV and papers are of these two industrialists. Narendra Modi ji works for those two industrialists and those two industrialists work for Narendra Modi ji.\"  He further said, \"Narendra Modi could not be the Prime Minister without the support of the media and two industrialists.\"  Speaking on the misuse of Central probe agencies, Rahul Gandhi said that he is not afraid of Enforcement Directorate (ED) and their questioning.  \"The ED asked me to sit for 55 hours but I am not afraid of your ED. Whether it is 55 hours or five months or five years,\" he said.  Rahul Gandhi said, \"PM Modi ji's ideology says that country should be divided and the profits from it should be shared among a few industrialists.\"  \"Congress gave India the historical MGNREGA, but Narendra Modi's government said in the Parliament that it's an insult to the poor. Today, if there would not have been MGNREGA, there would have been fires in the country. Our party took 27 crore people out of poverty but the BJP government has pushed 23 crore people into poverty in just ten years. Narendra Modi is taking the country backwards. This will help Pakistan and China and not India. The more there will be hatred and fear, the more the country would weaken,\" he said.  Rahul Gandhi said that the Congress' ideology can bring the country on the path of progress.  \"I want to ask you whether price rise and hatred strengthen the country. Narendra Modi and BJP are weakening the country. Congress party unites the country. We erase hatred and when hatred is erased, the country moves faster. Congress ideology can bring the country on the path of progress,\" he said.  He also said that all Opposition parties will come together and defeat the BJP and RSS.  \"We want to talk on China attack, unemployment, price rise, but BJP stopped our party. The institutions, whether it is the media, the judiciary, or the Election Commission, are all under pressure. So the only way that is left is to go to people. And that is why Congress will start the Bharat Jodo Yatra. This is a fight of ideology and all the Opposition parties will come together to defeat BJP and RSS,\" Rahul Gandhi told to people while addressing a massive rally.

      "body": "New Delhi: Former Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan G Parthasarthy on Thursday said that the US supplying $450 million equipment for F-16 fighters to Pakistan is a matter of concern as it gives the neighbouring enemy nation an edge in fighting capabilities.  “Those aircraft have advanced radar and missile capabilities. This is very clearly designed to give Pakistan an edge on fighting capabilities,” said Parthasarthy.   He said such capabilities have been used lethally in the past against us and it’s a very clear signal to India that US is  planning to give Pakistan the capabilities to match India.  “We should take it up with concern and signal should be sent to the US not just politically but in terms of action or issues of their concern because this is something we just can’t ignore,” the Former Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan added.  The Biden administration has approved a $450 million F-16 fighter jet fleet sustainment programme to Pakistan to help it meet current and future counterterrorism threats, in Washington’s first major security assistance to Islamabad in four years.  In 2018, Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump had suspended about $2 billion in security aid to Islamabad for failing to clamp down on the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network terror groups and dismantle their safe havens in the country.  In a notification to the US Congress on Wednesday, the State Department said it has approved a possible foreign military sale of F-16 case for sustainment and related equipment for an estimated cost of $450 million, arguing that this will sustain Islamabad’s capability to meet current and future counterterrorism threats by maintaining its F-16 fleet.  The Defence Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying the Congress of this possible sale on Wednesday.  “The United States Government has notified Congress of a proposed Foreign Military Sales case to sustain the Pakistan Air Force’s F-16 programme. Pakistan is an important counterterrorism partner, and as part of longstanding policy, the United States provides life cycle maintenance and sustainment packages for US-origin platforms,” a State Department spokesperson said.  “Pakistan’s F-16 programme is an important part of the broader United States-Pakistan bilateral relationship. The proposed sale will sustain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future counterterrorism threats by maintaining its F-16 fleet. The F-16 fleet allows Pakistan to support counterterrorism operations and we expect Pakistan to take sustained action against all terrorist groups,” the spokesperson added.  According to the Congressional notification, the proposed sale does not include any new capabilities, weapons, or munitions.  It said that Pakistan has requested to consolidate prior F-16 sustainment and support cases to support the Pakistan Air Force F-16 fleet by reducing duplicate case activities and adding additional continued support elements.  The $450 million foreign military sale to Pakistan participation in F-16 Aircraft Structural Integrity Programme, electronic combat international security assistance programme, international engine management programme, engine component improvement programme, and other technical coordination groups; aircraft and engine hardware and software modifications and support and aircraft and engine spare repair/return parts.  The Pentagon said this proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations.

      "body": "Surat: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said India has become the fifth largest economy in the world and this is not an ordinary achievement.  “Every Indian is feeling proud of it. We need to maintain this enthusiasm,” PM Modi said.  He was virtually addressing beneficiaries of various government schemes and those present at a mega medical camp organised in Olpad area of Surat city in Gujarat, where the Assembly polls are due later this year.  The PM interacted with some of the beneficiaries and appealed to farmers to switch to natural farming, saying this will result in better yield at minimum cost.  He lauded the Gujarat government and referred to the BJP-led state and the Centre as “double engine government”.  “Recently, India has become the fifth largest economy in the world. This achievement gave us confidence to work even harder and achieve bigger goals in this Amrit Kaal. This progress is not ordinary. Every Indian is feeling proud about it. We need to maintain this enthusiasm,” the Prime Minister said.  Referring to the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, PM Modi said, “As many as three crore houses were built by the government across the country for the poor during the last 8 years. Of these, nearly 10 lakh houses were constructed in Gujarat alone.”  PM Modi praised the health infrastructure in Gujarat, saying the state has a robust network of multispecialty hospitals.  “The number of medical colleges has gone up from 11 to 31 in the last two decades. An All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is coming up (in Rajkot) and several new medical colleges are also proposed for the state,” he said.  The entire event and the medical camp were organised by Gujarat Minister of State for Agriculture, Energy and Petrochemicals Mukesh Patel, who is the MLA from Olpad in Surat.  On the occasion, PM Modi urged doctors deployed at the medical camp to talk to patients about their lifestyle and the importance of having nutritious food, which can keep people away from many illnesses.  He said nearly four crore people in the country, including 30 lakh in Gujarat, have already availed benefit of the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat scheme, which provides health cover of up to Rs five lakh per family in a year.  Praising the Gujarat government, Modi said 97 per cent of rural homes in the state are now getting drinking water through the ambitious ‘Nal Se Jal’ scheme.  “Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, farmers across the country have received Rs two lakh crore through direct transfer so far. Sixty lakh farmers from Gujarat and nearly 1.25 lakh farmers from Surat have availed the benefit of this scheme,” he said.  He said farmers earlier used to get nothing despite tall promises made by previous governments at the Centre.  “But, the interests of farmers are always a priority for our double engine government. That is the reason why farmers of the country and Gujarat give us their blessings,” he said.  Before the address, PM Modi virtually interacted with some of the beneficiaries of the state and centrally sponsored schemes, such as the widow pension, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.  While talking to Sukhdevsinh Rana, a differently-abled farmer, the PM appealed to all cultivators to switch to natural farming, saying this would provide better yield with minimum cost.  During his interaction with Kanchanben Patel, a widow from Olpad taluka, Modi asked if coastal villages in Olpad are now getting Clean drinking water .  Patel informed the PM that the government has resolved the issue.  Talking to another widow Kirtiben Patel, Modi appealed to her to spread awareness about various government schemes in her village so that no eligible person is left behind in getting the benefits.

      "body": "Ghaziabad: In a horrific incident of dog attack that occurred last week, an 11-year-old boy was mauled by a pitbull, leaving the child scarred in the face, probably for life. The victim got some 150 stiches and remained in a hospital for three days, said reports.  The incident occurred in a park where the victim was playing and so was the dog with its owner, on September 3. However, the incident hogged headlines only on Thursday when a CCTV footage of the incident surfaced on the internet. The video shows the dog ran with the leash and attacked the kid.   Bystanders rescued the boy from dog’s clutches but it had already severely bitten the boy across his face. So much so, that paramedics had to give the victim over 100 stiches across the left side of the face till the ears.  Reports said the victim remained hospitalised for three days.  The incident invited angry reactions and outrage from residents of the area. Some of them demanded dog-owners to tape their pets’ mouth before bringing them to public spaces. “We must make some amends now in order to save our kids, they roam around like monnsters because we do not tape their mouth,” a resident tweeted.  The video got attention of the authorities. While the municipal corporation slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on the dog owner, Subhash Tyagi of Ghaziabad, for keeping the dog without license or registration.  Cops from Madhuban Bapudham Police Station, however, said they had not received any complaint. “Action will be taken if a complaint is filed,” Ghaziabad police tweeted.

      "body": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court will hear over 200 petitions challenging the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 on Monday, 12 September. The pleas will be heard by the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) UU Lalit and comprising Justice S Ravindra Bhatt.  The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, was notified on 12 December, 2019, and it came into force on January 10, 2020. It aims to give citizenship to migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan,  CAA evoked widespread protests across the country as it was perceived as an attempt to deprive Muslims of Indian citizenship.  For the unversed, in January 2020, the apex court had issued notice over the batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the CAA.  In December 2019, the top court bench comprising the then CJI Sharad A. Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant had asked the Centre to file a response by the second week of January. The court had said the CAA, 2019, is “uppermost in everybody’s minds”, but refused to stay the law without hearing the government first.  The petitions before the Supreme Court stated that the Act which liberalises and fast-tracks the grant of citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan “promotes religion-based discrimination”.  After this, the apex court in January 2020 granted four weeks time to the Central government to respond to the petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the CAA.  “CAA is a specific amendment which seeks to tackle a specific problem prevalent in the specified countries i.e. persecution on the ground of religion in light of the undisputable theocratic constitutional position in the specified countries..:, the government’s affidavit said.  It further clarified that the CAA does not impinge upon any existing right that may have existed prior to the enactment of the amendment and further, in no manner whatsoever, seeks to affect the legal, democratic or secular rights of any of the Indian citizens.

      "body": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated ‘Kartavya Path’ today. It symbolises a shift from erstwhile Rajpath being an icon of power, to Kartavya Path being an example of public ownership and empowerment. He also unveiled the statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate on occasion.   Addressing the gathering, the prime minister said in the time of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav the nation felt a new inspiration and energy. “Today, we are filling the picture of tomorrow with new colours, leaving behind the past. Today this new aura is visible everywhere, it is the aura of confidence of New India”, he said.   He continued “Kingsway i.e. Rajpath, the symbol of slavery, has become a matter of history from today and has been erased forever. Today a new history has been created in the form of ‘Kartavya Path’. I congratulate all the countrymen for their freedom from yet another identity of slavery, in this Amrit Kaal of independence.”  Modi said today a huge statue of our national hero Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose has also been installed near India Gate. “At the time of slavery, there was a statue of the representative of the British Raj. Today the country has also brought to life a modern, strong India by establishing the statue of Netaji at the same place”, he added.  Recalling the greatness of Netaji, the prime minister said “Subhas Chandra Bose was such a great man who was beyond the challenge of position and resources. His acceptance was such that the whole world considered him a leader. He had courage and self-respect. He had ideas, he had visions. He had leadership abilities and had policies.”  He said that no country should forget its glorious past. India’s glorious history is in every Indian’s blood and tradition. Netaji, the prime minister reminded, was proud of India’s heritage and at the same time, he wanted to make India modern.  “If after independence India had followed the path of Subhash Babu, what heights would the country be at today! But unfortunately, this great hero of ours was forgotten after independence. His ideas, even the symbols associated with them, were ignored”, prime minister lamented.  He recalled the visit to Netaji’s residence in Kolkata on the occasion of Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary and remembered the energy that he felt at that time. “It is our effort that Netaji’s energy should guide the country today. Netaji’s statue on the ‘Kartavya Path’ will become a medium for that'', he said. Modi said “In the last eight years, we have taken many such decisions one after the other, which are imprinted with the ideals and dreams of Netaji. He was the first head of Akhand Bharat, who freed Andaman before 1947 and hoisted the Tricolor. At that time he had imagined what it would be like to hoist the Tricolor at the Red Fort. I personally experienced this feeling, when I had the privilege of hoisting the Tricolor at the Red Fort on the occasion of 75 years of the Azad Hind government.” He also talked about the museum dedicated to Netaji and the Azad Hind Fauz in the Red Fort. He also remembered the Republic Day Parade in 2019 when a contingent of Azad Hind Army marched, a long-awaited honour for the veterans. Similarly, the identity and their association in the Andaman Islands were also strengthened.  Reiterating the nation's commitment to ‘Panch Pran’ the prime minister said “Today India’s ideals and dimensions are its own. Today India's resolve is its own and its goals are its own. Today our paths are ours, our symbols are our own.”  He continued “Today when the Rajpath ceases to exist and has become a Kartavya Path. Today the statue of Netaji has replaced the mark of the statue of George V, but this is neither the first nor the last example of the abandonment of slavery mentality. It is a continuous journey of determination till the goal of freedom of mind and spirit is achieved.”  He also talked of significant changes like the change of the name of the PM Residence to Lok Kalyan Marg in place of Racecourse road, Indian musical instruments in ceremonies of Independence Day and Beating the Retreat ceremony. He also referred to the change of ensign by the Indian Navy from colonial to the ensign of Chhatrapati Shivaji. “Similarly, the National War Memorial also represents the glory of the country”, he added.  The prime minister said these changes are not confined to the symbols but have also been infused in the policies of the country too. “Today the country has changed hundreds of laws that have been going on since the British era. The time and date of the Indian Budget, which was following the times of the British Parliament for so many decades, have also been changed. Through the National Education Policy, now the youth of the country are being liberated from the compulsion of foreign language”, he pointed out. “That means, both the thinking and the behaviour of the countrymen are freed from the mentality of slavery”, he added.  The prime minister emphasised that the Kartavya Path is not just a road of bricks and stones but a living example of India's democratic past and ideals. He reiterated that when the people of the country come here, the statue of Netaji and the National War Memorial will be a source of great inspiration and it will fill them with a sense of duty.  He expressed special gratitude toward the labourers not just for their physical contribution to the redevelopment of Kartavya Path but also their role in society that is an instance of duty toward the nation. Talking about his meeting with the labourers (shramjeevis), the prime minister praised the dream of the nation’s glory that they carry in their hearts.  They and their families will be the prime minister’s special guests on the next Republic Day Parade. Modi expressed happiness that today there is a tradition of respect for shram (labour) and shramjeevi (workers) in the country. He emphasised that with sensitivity in policies, there is sensitivity in decisions and ‘Shramev Jayate’ is becoming a mantra for the nation. He recalled instances of interactions with workers in Kashi Vishwanath Dham, Vikrant, and Prayagraj Kumbh. Workers working on the new Parliament Building will get a place of honour in one of the galleries, he informed.  The prime minister then went on to speak about the country's cultural infrastructure along with physical, digital, and transport infrastructure. For social infrastructure, he gave examples of new AIIMS and medical colleges, IITs, water connections, and Amrit Sarovars. Rural roads and the record number of modern expressways, railways and metro networks, and new airports are expanding transport infrastructure in an unprecedented manner. Optical fiber to panchayats and records of digital payments have made India’s digital infrastructure a topic of global appreciation.  But steps have also been taken to expand the cultural infrastructure related to history, national heroes and national heritage. He said that the development of such sites is also taking place with equal urgency. “Be it Sardar Patel's Statue of Unity or a museum dedicated to tribal freedom fighters, PM Museum or Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial, National War Memorial or National Police Memorial, these are examples of cultural infrastructure”, the prime minister added.  The prime minister stressed that an aspirational India can make rapid progress only by giving impetus to social, transport, digital and cultural infrastructure as a whole. “I am happy that today, the country is getting another great example of cultural infrastructure in the form of Kartavya Path”, the Prime Minister added.  He called upon every citizen of the country to visit this newly constructed Kartavya Path. “In its development, you will see the India of the future. The energy here will give you a new vision for our vast nation, a new belief”, the prime minister said. He also mentioned that a drone show based on the life of Netaji Subhash will take place for the next three days at the spot.  He urged the citizens to visit and take pictures which can be uploaded on social media with the hashtag #KartavyaPath. “I know this entire area is the heartbeat of the people of Delhi, and a large number of people come with their families to spend time in the evening. The planning, designing and lighting of the duty path has also been done keeping this in mind” he said. “I believe that this inspiration of Kartavya Path will create a flow of duty in the country and this flow will take us to the fulfilment of the resolve of a new and developed India,” he said.  Union Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Union Minister of Tourism, Shri G Kishan Reddy, Union Ministers of State of Culture of India, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal and Smt Meenakshi Lekhi and Union Minister of State of Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Kaushal Kishore were those present on the occasion.

      "body": "At an Enough is Enough rally in Manchester, a dinner lady told PoliticsJoe that she was dreading October when she will go back to work and would have to deny lunches to school children.   UK residents will see an 80 per cent increase in their annual household energy bills, the country’s energy regulator announced Friday, following a record 54 per cent spike in April. That will bring costs for the average customer from 1,971 pounds ($2,332) a year to 3,549 pounds.  The latest price cap, the maximum amount that gas suppliers can charge customers per unit of energy, will take effect on 1 October, 2022, just as the cold months set in. And bills are expected to rise again in January to 4,000 pounds.  To blame for the increase is the soaring price of wholesale natural gas triggered by Russia’s war in Ukraine, which is driving up consumer prices and roiling economies across Europe that rely on the fuel for heating homes and generating electricity.  That includes the United Kingdom, which has the highest inflation rate among the Group of Seven wealthiest democracies and seen disruptive strikes for months as workers push for pay to keep pace with the increasingly expensive cost of living.  The woman, who has not been named, was speaking at Enough is Enough rally on 30 August, 2022, at Manchester cathedral when she broke down in tears describing the child poverty at the Lancashire school where she works.    “Just before the summer holidays, when the cost of living crisis really started kicking off, I just noticed I was spending as much time taking food away from children as do serving it,” she told PoliticsJoe.  “To be honest, it’s not what I took the job for. I never dreamt I would be telling children ‘You can’t have that, you’ve no money in your account’,” she added.  She said that when she first started her role at the school, she would have to turn around one child a month away.  “Parents might forget to put money on at the beginning of the month, and you get that,” she added.  Now, though, the dinner lady said she was turning away some 10-15 children without money “every single day, every single shift”  “It’s breaking my heart,” she said, breaking down in tears. “They’re in a queue full of all their peers and other schoolchildren, and it’s humiliating for them.”  “They just look at you like ‘well, what am I going to eat’,” to which she said she responds with “I can’t give you anything, I’m sorry’  With the summer holidays drawing to a close, the dinner lady said she was “dreading” returning to work.”  “It’s getting to the point where I don’t think I can be doing this job anymore,” she added. “I didn’t take the job on to starve children.”  “You know, something has to give, and I just don’t think it should be children’s spirits, you know?\" the lady said.

      "body": "Aden: Twenty-one separatist fighters and six members of Al-Qaeda’s Yemen branch were killed Tuesday as an attack by the jihadists punctured months of relative peace in the war-torn country, government and security sources said.  Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) attacked positions held by the United Arab Emirates-trained Security Belt group in Abyan province in Yemen’s south, the sources told AFP.  The violence came just days after the jihadist group released a video of a United Nations worker whom it abducted in the same province more than six months ago.  About three hours of fighting “left 21 dead among the (Security Belt), including an officer, and six among the Al-Qaeda combatants”, a government official said on condition of anonymity. Two security sources confirmed the death toll.  Yemen has been gripped by conflict since Iran-backed Huthi rebels took control of the capital Sanaa in 2014, triggering a Saudi-led military intervention in support of the beleaguered government the following year.  AQAP and militants loyal to the Islamic State group have thrived in the chaos.  The Security Belt, a powerful southern Yemen separatist force, has played a decisive role in the fight against the jihadists, forcing them to retreat from towns into rural areas.  The force is tasked with protecting southern Yemeni regions which, with their access to the sea and the Horn of Africa, are of particular interest to the UAE.  The Security Belt said in a statement Tuesday that a “broad military campaign was launched several days ago by southern forces to fight terrorism in Abyan province”.  The violence comes as the Huthis and forces supporting the ousted government observe a shaky ceasefire in the years-long civil war.  Riven by divisions, the groups opposing the Huthis, who originate from the north, include southern separatists who support the re-establishment of South Yemen.  The country was divided into North and South Yemen until reunification in 1990.  Kidnapped UN worker  Underlining Yemen’s parlous security, on Saturday AQAP released a video showing a United Nations worker who was abducted more than six months ago, the SITE Intelligence Group reported.  Five UN staff members were kidnapped in Abyan in February while returning to the port city of Aden after a field mission, UN spokesperson Eri Kaneko told AFP at the time.  In Saturday’s video message apparently recorded on August 9, Akam Sofyol Anam, identified by SITE as a Bangladeshi, urges “the UN, the international community, the humanitarian organisations, to please come forward… and meet the demands of my captors”, without outlining the demands.  Formed in a merger of Al-Qaeda’s Yemen and Saudi branches, AQAP has carried out attacks on both rebel and government targets in Yemen as well as foreigners.  It has been accused of plotting attacks beyond the Middle East and its leaders have been targeted by a US drone war for more than two decades, although the number of strikes has dropped off in recent years.  Yemen’s UN-brokered ceasefire has drastically reduced fighting since the truce began in April, but outbreaks of violence continue.  Last week, 10 Yemeni soldiers were killed in a Huthi attack near Taez, the country’s third biggest city which has been blockaded by the rebels since 2015.  The assault, which also left several soldiers wounded, was aimed at cutting off a key route to the southwestern city of about two million, the government said.  On Thursday, the Huthis held a military parade in the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, drawing a rebuke from the UN.

      "body": "Washington: A man killed at least four people and wounded three others in an hours-long shooting rampage across Memphis on Wednesday, before a high-speed chase that ended with his arrest, police in the city said.  Officers identified the suspect as Ezekiel Kelly, 19, and said he was apprehended with two weapons in his vehicle at approximately 9:00 pm local time.  “[Kelly] was taken into custody without incident by the Memphis police department and the Shelby County sheriff’s office,” said Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis at a news conference.  Kelly is alleged to have killed his first victim just after midnight on Wednesday, and gone on a shooting spree across the Tennessee city in the afternoon and early evening, Davis said.  There were at least eight different crime scenes, police said, including car-jackings and a shooting at a local store, and Kelly had live-streamed parts of his spree.  “Ezekiel Kelly was on Facebook Live when he opened fire inside the store,” said Davis.  Authorities issued a “shelter in place” order while the shootings were ongoing, effectively locking down parts of the city.  The United States regularly sees mass shootings and other gun violence, but Congress has been reluctant to pass strict gun control legislation as the issue remains politically divisive.  At least 490 people have been killed in mass shootings and mass murders in the US in 2022 so far, according to the Gun Violence Archive, with 14,050 people dying in gun-related incidents over the same period, excluding suicides.  Memphis has seen a string of high-profile killings in recent months, including the murder of a pastor during a carjacking and the abduction and murder last week of a woman who was on a pre-dawn run.  “I am angry. I am angry for [the victims] and I’m angry for our citizens who had to shelter in place for their own safety until this suspect was caught,” said Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland following Wednesday’s shootings.  “This is no way for us to live, and it is not acceptable,” said the Mayor.

      "body": "WASHINGTON: Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, returned to the White House Wednesday, unveiling official portraits with a modern vibe in an event that set humor and nostalgia over his presidency against the current harsh political talk about the survival of democracy.  While her husband cracked a few jokes about his gray hair, big ears and clothes in his portrait, Mrs. Obama, a descendant of slaves, said the occasion for her was more about the promise of America for people like herself.  “Barack and Michelle, welcome home,” declared President Joe Biden as the gathering cheered.  Biden, who was Obama’s vice president, praised his former boss’ leadership on health care, the economy and immigration and said nothing could have prepared him any better for being president than serving with Obama for those eight years.  “It was always about doing what was right,” he said.  The portrait of Obama, America’s 44th and first Black president, doesn’t look like any of his predecessors, nor does Michelle Obama’s look like any of the women who filled the role before her.  Obama stands expressionless against a white background, wearing a black suit and gray tie in the portrait by Robert McCurdy that looks more like a large photograph than an oil-on-canvas portrait. The former first lady, her lips pursed, is seated on a sofa in the Red Room in a strapless, light blue dress. She chose artist Sharon Sprung for her portrait.  Scores of former members of Obama’s administration were on hand for the big reveal.  Obama noted that some of them in the East Room audience had started families in the intervening years and feigned disappointment “that I haven’t heard of anyone naming a kid Barack or Michelle.”  He thanked McCurdy for his work, joking that the artist, who is known for his paintings of public figures from Nelson Mandela to the Dalai Lama, had ignored his pleas for fewer gray hairs and smaller ears. “He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way,” Obama quipped, referring to a widely panned appearance as president in the unflattering suit.  Obama went on to say his wife was the “best thing about living in the White House,” and he thanked Sprung for “capturing everything I love about Michelle, her grace, her intelligence – and the fact that she’s fine.”  Michelle Obama, when it was her turn, laughingly opened by saying she had to thank her husband for “such spicy remarks.” To which he retorted, by way of explanation, “I’m not running again.”  Then the former first lady turned serious, drawing a connection between unveiling the portraits and America’s promise for people with backgrounds like her own, a daughter of working-class parents from the South Side of Chicago.  “For me, this day is not just about what has happened,” she said. “It’s also about what could happen, because a girl like me, she was never supposed to be up there next to Jacqueline Kennedy and Dolley Madison. She was never supposed to live in this house, and she definitely wasn’t supposed to serve as first lady.”  Mrs. Obama said the portraits are a “reminder that there’s a place for everyone in this country.”  Tradition holds that the sitting president invites his immediate predecessor back to the White House to unveil his portrait, but Donald Trump broke with that custom and did not host Obama. So, Biden scheduled a ceremony for his former boss.  Mrs. Obama said the tradition matters “not just for those of us who hold these positions, but for everyone participating in and watching our democracy.”  In remarks that never mentioned Trump but made a point as he continues to challenge his 2020 reelection loss, she added: “You see the people, they make their voices heard with their vote. We hold an inauguration to ensure a peaceful transition of power … and once our time is up, we move on.”  McCurdy, meanwhile, said his “stripped down” style of portraiture helps create an “encounter” between the person in the painting and the person looking at it.  “They have plain white backgrounds, nobody gestures, nobody — there are no props because we’re not here to tell the story of the person that’s sitting for them,” McCurdy told the White House Historical Association during an interview for its “1600 Sessions” podcast.  “We’re here to create an encounter between the viewer and the sitter,” he said. “We’re telling as little about the sitter as possible so that the viewer can project onto them.”  He works from a photograph of his subject, selected from about 100 images, and spends at least a year on each portrait. Subjects have no say in how the painting looks. McCurdy said he knows he’s done “when it stops irritating me.”  Obama’s portrait went on display in the Grand Foyer, the traditional showcase for paintings of the two most recent presidents. His portrait replaced Bill Clinton’s near the stairway to the residence, the White House tweeted Wednesday night. George W. Bush’s portrait hangs on the wall opposite Obama’s in the foyer.  Mrs. Obama’s portrait was hung one floor below on the Ground Floor, joining predecessors Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush, according to the tweet.  Two spokespeople for Trump did not respond to emailed requests for comment on whether artists have begun work on White House portraits for Trump and former first lady Melania Trump. Work, however, is underway on a separate pair of Trump portraits bound for the collection held by the National Portrait Gallery, a Smithsonian museum.  The White House Historical Association, a nonprofit organization founded in 1961 by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and funded through private donations and sales of books and an annual Christmas ornament, helps manage the White House portrait process. Since the 1960s, the association has paid for most of the portraits in the collection.  Congress bought the first painting in the collection, of George Washington. Other portraits of early presidents and first ladies often came to the White House as gifts.

      "body": "Kyiv: Ukraine on Thursday claimed a military breakthrough in its counter-offensive against Russian invaders as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a surprise visit to Kyiv, unveiled another $2.8 billion in military aid.  Ukraine said its forces made gains both in the north, the south and the east, prying back land seized by Russia which had hoped for a swift victory when it attacked nearly seven months ago.  In the area around Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, forces penetrated 50 kilometres (30 miles) beyond Russian lines and “liberated” more than 20 towns and villages, senior military official Oleksiy Gromov said.  Hoping to build the momentum, Blinken secretly travelled to Kyiv for his second trip during the war, passing through dark hallways with sandbags in the sealed presidential compound to discuss the military aid with President Volodymyr Zelensky.  Presenting a state award to Blinken, the Ukrainian leader voiced gratitude for the “enormous support” from the United States, saying it was “a guarantee that we can return our territories.”  Blinken vowed that the United States would keep up assistance “until the aggression ceases and Ukraine is fully sovereign”.  “You have our word — and our track record,” said Blinken, sporting a tieless suit across from the unshaven Zelensky in his now signature military green T-shirt.  “What we see is costs on Russia that are already extraordinary and they are going to get heavier and heavier,” Blinken said.  The latest package includes $675 million to be shipped shortly in arms, ammunition and supplies and another $1 billion in longer-term loans and grants for Ukraine to buy more US equipment.  The State Department also approved $1.2 billion for 18 other nations seen as facing threats from Russia including Baltic states, Moldova and Georgia, which both have breakaway regions backed by Moscow.  A day after the United Nations said there were “credible reports” of Russia forcing Ukrainian children into its territory, Blinken started his trip by visiting toddlers injured in the war at a hospital.  In a room with toy trucks and alien figurines, he arrived with a basket of stuffed animals, announcing, “I brought some friends.”  “The spirit of your children sends a very strong message around the world,” he said.  Blinken also knelt down to pat Patron, a fabled Jack Russell terrier that has helped Ukraine’s military find more than 200 mines laid by Russian forces.  Allies pledge support  In a coordinated display of resolve, Biden was to speak by telephone with leaders of allies on Ukraine and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met his counterparts at Ramstein air base in Germany.  “Now, we’re seeing the demonstrable success of our common efforts on the battlefield,” Austin said.  Amid Ukraine’s reports of gains, Russia also trumpeted battlefield successes, saying it had hit five command posts and downed 13 drones on Thursday.  Addressing a forum in Moscow, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Russia had withstood Western sanctions over the war better than expected, estimating that GDP had fallen just over one percent year-on-year in the first six months of 2022.  Russia’s central bank expects a contraction of four to six percent for the year, while Blinken cited an estimate of an even steeper drop.  “Unprecedented sanctions were imposed on our country. But their initiators did not achieve their main objective. They failed to undermine our financial stability,” Mishustin said.  But as the war grinds on, both sides have increasingly been facing a crunch on military supplies with US officials saying Russia, long a major defence exporter, was buying drones from Iran and large quantities of rocket and artillery shells from North Korea.  Speaking at Ramstein, top US General Mark Milley said there was “significant consumption of munitions” by Ukraine that will need to be addressed by allies.  In new pledges to Ukraine, Norway offered 160 Hellfire missiles and night-vision equipment, Germany offered winter supplies and The Netherlands joined Germany with demining training.  US aid tops $15 bn  The latest package by the United States — Ukraine’s largest supplier — includes 105mm howitzers, precision-guided GMLRS rockets and artillery ammunition.  It brings  US military aid to Ukraine since the invasion to $15.2 billion.  Among the most efficient weapons sent by Washington are the HIMAR multiple rocket launch systems, which are paired with GMLRS rockets that can reach targets up to 80 kilometres (50 miles) away.  But Kyiv is seeking ATACMS — precision-guided, medium range tactical missiles capable of striking 300 kilometres.  The United States has so far refused as it fears the missiles could land in Russian territory, sparking an even bigger conflict.  “Right now, the policy of the United States government is that we’re not sending ATACMS,” Milley said.  “The range of the HIMARS is sufficient to meet the needs of the Ukrainians as they are currently fighting.”  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

      "body": "Washington: Russian President Vladimir Putin is “weaponising” its energy resources, the White House has alleged, a day after he threatened to cut off all energy exports to the West if the US proceeded with its oil price cap.  Putin on Wednesday threatened to completely cut energy supplies to the West if it tries to cap prices of Russian exports.  He also vowed to press on with Moscow’s military action in Ukraine until it achieves its goals.  “This shows that Putin is, again, weaponising energy, by his very words, also by his actions. But the President (Joe Biden) and our partners in Europe predicted this playbook. We saw this coming, and we have been preparing for months. We have talked through the different processes of how this price cap could look,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday during her daily news conference.  Finance ministers from the G7 last week pledged to put in place a system designed to cap Russia’s income from oil sales that it could use to further its war in Ukraine.  The move by the seven most industrialised nations also aimed at limiting the impact of the Ukraine war on soaring global energy prices.  The US and European Union, she said, have set up a task force to work on ways to increase alternate sources of natural gas to Europe and help reduce Europe’s demand for Russian energy through increased efficiency and clean energy deployment.  “That is something that we’re going to continue to do to be helpful to Europe as they head into the winter months. But this process of the task force already has had a positive effect as we’ve seen. Europe’s gas shortage will be full by the critical winter heating season. Germany will reach their target gas storage, despite the Russian cuts, ahead of schedule. And Europe as a whole will reach a significantly higher level than last year,” she said.  “We prepared for this. We knew this was going to be part of the playbook, in Russia weaponising energy as they have been for the past several months, and so we will be prepared for this move,” said the press secretary.  Meanwhile, at a different press briefing, State Department’s Deputy Press Secretary Vedant Patel told reporters that the Black Sea Grain Initiative is a humanitarian arrangement to bring desperately needed food to the world’s hungry populations.  “The US did not offer nor did it provide any sanctions relief in exchange for Russia’s participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative. As a matter of fact, US sanctions have always had clear exemptions for food and fertiliser, and our sanctions have never targeted humanitarian assistance,” he clarified.  “We want to see food and fertiliser reach global markets. And Russia must continue to live up to its commitments through the Black Grain Sea Initiative. And some of these other allegations that we’ve seen that, one, global food prices are rising, just aren’t the case. In fact, global food prices have fallen as a result of the Black Sea Port arrangement,” he said.

      "body": "As the iPhone 14 series was launched on 7 September at the Apple’s ‘Far Out’ event, memes flooded social media like wildfire. And this time, Eve Jobs – daughter of Steve Jobs – also joined the trend.  She posted a meme on her Instagram story which is sarcastically showing how iPhone 14 is the same as iPhone 13. In the hilarious meme, a man can be seen holding the exact same shirt in his hand as he is wearing. The meme she shared was captioned, “Me upgrading from iPhone 13 to iPhone 14 after Apple’s announcement today.”Reportedly, a lot of core hardware is common in iPhone 14 and iPhone 13. In both versions of the phone, even the SoC is the same. The core camera hardware, screen, and probably the battery are also reportedly the same.  But this is not the case with the pro models of iPhone 14. The iPhone 14 pro is very different from the iPhone 13 pro. They both have different core hardware. The iPhone 14 pro has a new A16 Bionic chipset, and a new screen with a unique pill-shaped notch. Apple has termed the notch as “Dynamic Island”.  iPhone 14 is not completely similar to the previous version. For example, iPhone 14 will have the facility of eSIM, and the users won’t have to insert a physical card for connecting to their cellular provider. The eSIM will not require Wi-Fi to set up. The US models won’t be having sim trays anymore, but international models will have one.  iPhone 14 has come up with many interesting features. For example, it has a satellite SOS connectivity feature which works without needing an internet connection. In the USA and Canada, this service will be offered for free for two years. The phone also has the feature of crash detection which will notify the emergency services in case of an accident.  Apart from the iPhones, the company also launched new Apple Watch Series 8, including Apple Watch Ultra, and the AirPods Pro 2.  The starting price of iPhone 14 has been set at Rs. 79,900, while the iPhone 14 Plus holds a price tag of Rs. 89,900. The price of iPhone 14 Pro begins at Rs. 1,29,900, while Rs. 1,39,900 is the price of iPhone 14 Pro Max.

      "body": "After being awarded the Grandmaster title by FIDE, 19-year-old American chess master Hans Niemann is currently the source of the biggest scandal in chess since 2006. This is after the American chess player has been accused of cheating ever since the world champion Magnus Carlsen called it quits to the $500,000 Sinquefield Cup, after losing a game to the 19-year-old on 4 September.  Even many theories are making rounds on the internet that says Hans has cheated in the tournament using wireless anal beads, which aid him by vibrating the correct moves. Now, jumping on the bandwagon, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has weighed on the conspiracy theory.  Taking it to his Twitter account, Chief Engineer at SpaceX suggested that the top chess player has cheated using vibrating anal breading.  This is after a Twitter user posted a video of a content creator giving his views on Hans using wireless anal beads. While posting the video, which has taken the internet by storm, the user wrote, “Currently obsessed with the notion that Hans Niemann has been cheating at the Sinquefield Cup chess tournament using wireless anal beads that vibrate him the correct moves.”  Now re-sharing the viral post, Musk quoted the German Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer’s quote. The Tesla CEO tweeted, “Talent hits a target no one else can hit, genius hits a target no one can see (cause it’s in your butt)” – Schopenhauer.”  “Talent hits a target no one else can hit, genius hits a target no one can see (cause it’s in ur butt)” – Schopenhauer https://t.co/PeSqzgFVxh  — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 8, 2022   Despite all the claims buzzing over the internet, Hans broke his silence by admitting that he cheated by using computer assistance when playing online as a child, but denied any such wrongdoings at this tournament.  In a recent interview on 6 September, Hans said that in order to prove himself innocent, the American player was prepared to play “naked”. The Guardian quoted Hans as saying, “If they want me to strip fully naked, I will do it. I don’t care. Because I know I am clean. You want me to play in a closed box with zero electronic transmission, I don’t care.”",

According to the sources, the meeting is likely to take place at 4:30 pm where prominent dignitaries of the party including Home Minister Amit Shah, party president JP Nadda, Organization General Secretary BL Santosh, Joint Secretary Organization V Satish along with cluster incharge of constituencies will be present.  The 144 constituencies of Lok Sabha have been divided into different clusters each with a minister in charge.  Smriti Irani, Dharmendra Pradhan, Piyush Goyal, Bhupendra Yadav, Anurag Thakur, Narendra Tomar, Sanjeev Balyan and Mahendra Pandey are amongst the 14-15 prominent ministers who were given charge of these clusters.  As per the party sources, the meeting will seek a report from these cluster incharge under the Lok Sabha Pravas Yojana and the ground reality of about 144 Lok Sabha constituencies will be considered. The meeting will also discuss the steps that the party should take to ensure victory in the Lok Sabha 2024 elections.  The ministers were given a deadline of 31 August to prepare these reports which shall be considered in the meeting today.  Several ministers in the PM Modi cabinet were assigned with the task to maintain the report after Home Minister Amit Shah and Party’s national president JP Nadda partially visited about 144 Lok Sabha seats where they are weak and took the responsibility to identify the necessary steps with the intention to register victory here.  Of these 144 constituencies, most are the ones where either the party could not register a victory or were defeated due to a lesser number of votes. Keeping this in view, several ministers were asked to prepare a report by residing in two or three Lok Sabha constituencies to identify the measures that can help them win.  All cluster incharge visited almost all the assigned Lok Sabha constituencies and have also identified the steps that need to be taken to ensure victory there.

The two leaders are believed to have discussed the current political situation in the country and ways to ensure Opposition unity, PTI reported.  Kumar also met Janata Dal (Secular) chief H D Kumaraswamy at the latter’s residence.  The meeting between Gandhi and Kumar at the former Congress chief’s residence lasted almost an hour. Kumar was accompanied by Bihar Water Resources Minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Sanjay Kumar Jha.  “There is a concerted effort to weaken regional parties. My effort is to unite the Opposition ahead of the General Elections. I have no intention of pitching myself as a prime ministerial candidate,” Kumar told reporters after the meeting.  This is the first meeting between Gandhi and Kumar since the latter walked out of the NDA in Bihar and formed a ‘Mahagathbandhan’ government with RJD, Congress, and outside support of the Left.   Kumar arrived in the national capital on Monday. He is likely to meet several opposition leaders including NCP’s Sharad Pawar, AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal, CPI-M’s Sitaram Yechury, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and INLD supremo Om Prakash Chautala on Tuesday.  Kumar is making attempts to bring all opposition parties together as a united force against the BJP for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.  The JD(U) leader is being talked about in political circles as a key face to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.  Taking a swipe at Kumar, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) leader and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan said a chief minister who ordered lathi-charge on those seeking jobs is on a three-day visit to Delhi with prime ministerial ambitions.  Instead of focusing on Bihar’s development, he is busy trying to unite the Opposition, Paswan said in a tweet in Hindi and tagged Kumar in it.

      "body": "New Delhi: Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena on Monday sent a legal notice to AAP leaders, accusing them of levelling “false and derogatory” allegations against him, days after they claimed he was involved in a Rs 1,400-crore “scam” during his tenure as the KVIC chairman.  The notice, served to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its leaders Atishi, Durgesh Pathak, Saurabh Bharadwaj, Sanjay Singh and Jasmine Shah, among others, alleged they have unleashed a “vilification campaign” due to vendetta as Saxena’s actions have exposed the “corruption” of key AAP leaders.  It asked them to issue a press release “directing all members of the party and all persons associated with it, whether directly or indirectly, to cease and desist from spreading and circulating false, defamatory, malicious and unsubstantiated statements”.  The legal notice also asked the AAP leaders to comply with the requisitions within 48 hours of its receipt.  AAP sources hit out at the LG for sending legal notice to its leaders, saying he should stop threatening people.  If he has done no wrong, why is he so scared of CBI raid and investigation? Why does he not offer himself for an independent enquiry? He should stop threatening people,” a source in the party said.  The LG cannot silence ”our voice against corruption”, the AAP source said. The notice alleged that the “perversity and malice” in the actions of the party in “unleashing a vilification campaign” against Saxena, is “a carefully planned move by AAP, tainted with the objective of digressing the attention of the people in view of the recent law enforcement actions having been taken against its senior leader(s)”.  “At the very outset, I strongly condemn the libelous acts as set out in this notice, by Aam Aadmi Party, its office bearers…who have made/ published/ circulated or caused to be made/ published/ circulated, libelous allegations against my lient,” the notice said.  It claimed the “‘false, malicious, motivated, tainted with collateral objectives, unfounded and misconceived allegations having been made knowingly and deliberately, calculated to harm the dignity, reputation and honor of my client, built brick by brick by his relentless hard work over the years”.  The notice claimed that all this is likely to have an effect on his family members, social circles and people at his workplace. “The collateral object of this vilification campaign is to browbeat my client and to discourage him from performing his Constitutional obligations in his capacity as the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.  “It is categorically stated… that the entire vilification campaign, its contents, the innuendos, imputations, attributions and insinuations are patently false, entirely unsubstantiated, calculated, distorted,” it added.  The AAP has been up in arms against the LG with Pathak alleging in the Assembly last week that as the chairman of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), Saxena had pressured his employees to exchange demonetised currency notes worth Rs 1,400 crore in 2016. The MLAs also held an overnight dharna in the Assembly complex and have demanded a CBI probe into the allegation against the LG.  The AAP’s allegations came close on the heels of Saxena recommending a CBI probe into alleged corruption in the implementation of the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 and the party’s accusations that he was “interfering” in the city government’s work. The notice by LG also cited figures from the Annual Report of KVIC for the year 2016-17, when Saxena was the chairman and the purported scan took place. “It may be known, that the total Khadi sale across the country during 2016-17 was Rs 2146.60 crore as per KVIC Annual Report 2016-17. There were only 7 Departmental Store Outlets (DSOs) of KVIC, sale from which was Rs 173.58 crore during the entire year of 2016-17, while the remaining was sale done through independent Khadi Institution stores and franchisees.  “‘Out of sale of Rs 173.58 crore from these 7 DSOs during the year, Rs 99.35 crore was through retail sales and the remaining was through the wholesale and government supplies.  ”Since the period under demonetisation was from 9.11.2016 to 31.12.2016, therefore on a pro-rata basis, retail sales worth approximately only Rs 14.43 Cr (actual may vary) took place through these 7 DSOs during the period of demonetisation. Hence, by any stretch of the imagination, whatsoever, the figure of Rs 1400 cr is not only incompatible…” said the notice. The notice said that the AAP was doing it “solely with the aim of deflecting and diverting the attention of the people from the gross failure of the AAP Government in Delhi, the expose in the recently unearthed Excise and Classroom scam coupled with the “appreciation gained by Saxena for the “extraordinary work done by him in the past three months serving as the LG of Delhi”.  Ever since he joined this distinguished office, he has diligently and meticulously discharged his Constitutional duties and responsibilities, with an intention to effect good governance in Delhi for the betterment of the public.  “While ensuring that the law of the land and statute are upheld in both letter and spirit, my client has taken several tough decisions in the larger public interest, which may not be palatable to AAP. Thus, the present smear campaign is nothing but the bestial vendetta against my client whose actions have unveiled, amongst other things, rampant irregularities and corruption by some key leaders of AAP, the notice read.  The notice also highlighted the alleged “irregularities” by the AAP government that have been flagged by Saxena.  Based on the LG’s recommendations, the CBI had registered an FIR in connection with the alleged excise policy scam and raided Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia”s residence. Sisodia is one of the accused in the matter.  Saxena had also sought a report from the chief secretary last week over a delay of more than two-and-a-half years in acting on a Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) report on an inquiry into the construction of additional classrooms in Delhi government schools.

      "body": "New Delhi: All eyes are on the much-awaited inauguration of the “Kartavya Path”, previously known as Rajpath and the unveiling of a statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at the India Gate, but politics over the event is gaining momentum where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee declined the invitation for the event saying that it was “not proper”.  Banerjee said that she received a letter on Wednesday from a bureaucrat informing about the unveiling of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose statue at the ‘Kartavya Path’ by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today.  “I received a letter yesterday from a undersecretary saying the Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Netaji statue at 7 pm and you must be there at 6 pm. As if I am their boned labour. How can an undersecretary write to a Chief Minister? Why has the culture minister become so big,” the West Bengal chief minister said at a party gathering in Kolkata.  She further said, “That’s why I garlanded the Netaji statue here in the afternoon today to offer my respects.”  BJP Co-incharge West Bengal Amit Malviya hit back at Banerjee and accused her for doing “nothing” to honour the legacy of Netaji. “Now that Prime Minister has taken the historic decision, she is making puerile attempts to sully the solemn occasion,” he added.   Malviya further said that the West Bengal chief minister is \"feeling bad\" that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's statue is being installed in the heart of Delhi.  Kartavya Path is a stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and will be like a green pathway with red granite walkways, state-wise food stalls, new amenity blocks, refurbished canals.  The event will commence at 7:00 pm on Thursday (8 September) when the Prime Minister will unveil a 28-foot statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose near India Gate and inaugurate the refurbished Central Vista avenue.  Banerjee also attacked the Centre for not being invited to meet the visiting Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is on a four-day India tour.  \"I share a very good relationship with Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, but the Centre did not invite me to be part of her official visit to India,\" she said.  Banerjee further claimed that it was for the first time that the Bangladesh PM is in India and Bengal has been left out. \"I heard Hasina ji wanted to meet me. I have very good relations with her family,\" she remarked.  With inputs from agencies  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

      "body": "New Delhi: Days after Madras High Court approved his elevation as AIADMK’s interim general secretary, Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday termed his rival O Panneerselvam as “chameleon” and accused him of betraying the party.  “OPS had led the violence at party HQ, how can the party cadre accept his return to the party? He has betrayed the party. OPS is like a chameleon,” said Palaniswami.   Palaniswami, popularly known as EPS, returned to the party headquarters today for the first time after his position as the single, supreme leader of AIADMK was strengthened by the Madras High Court order.   In a show of strength, hundreds of party workers, and elected MLAs and MPs gave Palaniswami a rousing reception as he paid tributes to the statues of the former Tamil Nadu chief ministers, MG Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa.  “Elections will be held soon for the post of party’s general secretary. Today, we entered the party headquarters and paid our respects to party leaders late MGR and late J Jayalalithaa,” he said.   On the party leadership dispute, the Madras High Court had on 2 September, allowed Palaniswami’s appeal and set aside an earlier order in favour of Panneerselvam.  A division bench comprising Justice M Duraiswamy and Justice Sundar Mohan set aside an order of a single judge, which nullified the 11 July General Council meeting of the AIADMK.  In that meeting held in July, leader of opposition EPS was elected as the interim general secretary of the party, the top post. Panneerselvam was ousted from the party.  O Panneerselvam, meanwhile, said the High Court verdict would be challenged in the Supreme Court.

      "body": "Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has kick-started Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s ‘Make India Number 1’ campaign on the same day that Rahul Gandhi is flagging off Congress’ Bharat Jodo Yatra.  AAP’s nationwide campaign comes with an eye on the upcoming Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh Assembly polls, slated later this year, and 2024 Lok Sabha elections.  Launching the campaign in his hometown of Hisar in Haryana, Kejriwal, flanked by Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann, said India can lead the world but our system is broken.  “In the past 75 years, these political parties have done bad politics. If left in their hands, the country will remain backward for another 75 years.”  What is AAP’s ‘Make India No 1’ campaign? Is AAP trying to upstage Congress?  Let’s take a detailed look:  What is ‘Make India Number 1’  Under its nationwide Make India No 1 campaign, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal will travel across states, hold rallies, youth meetings and tiranga yatras, as per Economic Times.  Starting the campaign from Hisar, Kejriwal will participate in a rally in Adampur.  He will interact with the party’s rank and file, address a youth sammelan and hold a tiranga yatra.  Elaborating on the reason for choosing Haryana for commencing the campaign, a senior AAP leader told ET, on condition of anonymity, “AAP is trying to build its party organisation in Haryana. The village level initiative of going door-to-do or to build party organisation has yielded a good response. The two-day programme of Kejriwal ji will give it further fillip.”  Is AAPs Make India Number 1 campaign a bid to upstage Congress Bharat Jodo Yatra AAP is eyeing Gujarat and HP Assembly elections as well as 2024 LS polls with its campaign. News18 File Photo  On Tuesday, Kejriwal had said in a video message, “A few days ago, we launched a programme – Make India Number 1. It is the dream of 130 crore people to see India become world’s number one country.”  Further, he apprised that after Haryana, he will visit other states and urge people to join the movement. “Now, there will have to be an alliance of 130 crore people. We have to work like a team, like a family. If it happens, then no one can stop us from making India the world’s number 1 country,” Quint quoted the AAP chief as saying.  During an event in Delhi’s Talkatora Stadium, Kejriwal had announced a number – 9510001000 — on which people can give a missed call to join the Make India Number 1 movement.  AAP’s national ambitions  With Make India Number 1 movement, AAP plans to dent BJP’s stronghold Gujarat in the coming election and emerge as a challenge to Narendra Modi in the 2024 general election, AAP sources told PTI.   The party’s national aspirations have been fuelled by its recent landslide victory in Punjab and its entry into Goa where it bagged two of the 40 Assembly seats.  “The BJP-led central government has ruined the country’s economy by writing off loans worth crores of rupees to benefit the prime minister’s friends and also reduced the corporate tax but did not give any relief to the common people. We will tell people about the wrongdoings of the Modi government and their impact on their lives,” PTI quoted a party source as saying.  While interacting with the masses, AAP will stress on the necessity of imparting free education to children, improving the quality of government schools, providing free healthcare facilities, electricity and water as well as generating employment and livelihood opportunities.  Congress’ Bharat Jodo Yatra  Calling its mass-outreach programme a “turning point in Indian politics”, Congress has said the yatra “is meant for peace and not to divide”.  The grand old party is seeking to rejuvenate its standing in national politics with its Bharat Jodo Yatra covering 12 states in more than 100 days.  Rahul Gandhi, along with 117 Congress members, will highlight “economic disparities, social polarisation and political centralisation” during the yatra, PTI reported.  Is AAPs Make India Number 1 campaign a bid to upstage Congress Bharat Jodo Yatra Rahul Gandhi will begin the Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari on 8 September. Twitter/@bharatjodo  Earlier in the day, after attending a prayer meeting at Rajiv Gandhi memorial in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur, the former Congress president said in a tweet, “I lost my father to the politics of hate and division. I will not lose my beloved country to it too.”  “Love will conquer hate. Hope will defeat fear. Together, we will overcome,” Rahul said ahead of the yatra’s launch in Kanyakumari.  AAP’s attempt to outshine Congress?  AAP has claimed that Kejriwal’s campaign was always on the horizon and called the timing coinciding with Congress’ 3,570 kilometre padyatra a “coincidence”, Indian Express reported.  Dismissing Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, senior AAP leaders said it holds no significance. “The Congress is shrinking each day. With their MLAs up for sale in each state, they have lost relevance. Their yatra is of no consequence as people see AAP as the only viable opposition in states where the BJP and Congress were the dominant parties,” a party leader told Indian Express.  Is AAPs Make India Number 1 campaign a bid to upstage Congress Bharat Jodo Yatra Congress and AAP have dismissed each other’s campaigns. PTI Photo  Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma today stirred controversy with his remark on Congress’ Bharat Jodo Yatra. “If they want to start Bharat Jodo Yatra, then Rahul Gandhi should do this in Pakistan. What are the benefits of doing this Yatra in India? India is connected, and united. I want to suggest Rahul Gandhi to take the Bharat Jodo Yatra programme to Pakistan,” Sarma told ANI.  Meanwhile, Congress hit out at AAP over its ‘Make India No 1’ movement, saying the Kejriwal-led party is imitating them.  Congress MP and AICC Delhi in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil told Indian Express that their fight is with the BJP and “it will remain with the BJP.”  With inputs from agencies  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

      "body": "Kanyakumari: Making a strong pitch for Rahul Gandhi to assume the mantle of Congress president, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday said if that happens the party will be strengthened and remain united to meet challenges.  Gehlot, who is himself seen as a front-runner for the post if Gandhi does not relent to the appeals by party rank and file to take charge, said the biggest quality of the Gandhi family is that they take decisions in the interest of the party.  “Why does every party member say that Rahul Gandhi should become party chief. Today also, why Congress men and women are after Rahul Gandhi that he becomes president, because if he becomes president, the party will remain united,” he told a press conference here ahead of the launch of the party’s ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’.  The Congress people are of the opinion that Rahul Gandhi should become party president, he said. “We lost an election in 2019 and he (Gandhi) resigned taking moral responsibility. He had said in CWC that he will do what the party asks him to do but does not want to be chief. We want that he becomes party chief and all of us workers will work together under his leadership and leave no stone unturned, the party will move forward, will be strengthened and meet the challenges,” Gehlot said.  There are big challenges before the country and if Rahul Gandhi becomes the party chief it will be easier to deal with them, he added.  Hailing the Gandhi family for its contributions, Gehlot said that for 30 years no member of the Gandhi family became prime minister and it was not as if they did not get a chance as Sonia Gandhi did but she made Manmohan Singh the prime minister.  She came into politics to unite the party which was disintegrating, Gehlot said.  “We had to say to her that ‘if you don’t accept and the Congress disintegrates, history will not forgive you’, we had to say that for her to come into politics and then see how she gained so much respect in the next 20-24 years,” the senior Congress leader said.  Several Congress leaders have publicly exhorted Rahul Gandhi to return as the party chief. However, uncertainty and suspense continue on the issue. Several party insiders say Rahul Gandhi is persisting with his stance that he will not be the All India Congress Committee (AICC) president.  Gehlot in the past had sought to play down reports about him being the frontrunner for the Congress president’s post saying efforts would be made till the last minute to persuade Rahul Gandhi to take over the reins of the party again.  Rahul Gandhi had resigned as Congress president after the party suffered its second consecutive defeat in the 2019 parliamentary elections. Sonia Gandhi who took over the reins of the party again as interim president had also offered to quit in August 2020 after an open revolt by a section of leaders, referred to as G-23, but the CWC had urged her to continue.  The Congress has announced the detailed schedule for the AICC president polls with the notification to be out on 22 September. The process for filing nominations for the election will be held from 24 to 30 September. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is 8 October and the election, if required, will be held on 17 October. The results will be out on 19 October.

      "updateddate": "September 08, 2022 17:50:57 IST",
      "body": "On Thursday, Maharashtra police removed LED lights around the grave of 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon at south Mumbai’s Bada Kabarastan.  The pictures of Memon’s grave adorned with marble titles, halogen and LED lights went viral on social media, sparking a major controversy.  The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attacked at Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, saying the incident has “exposed” the former Maharashtra chief minister.  The saffron party has demanded an apology from Thackeray and his Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance partners– Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar and Congress’ Rahul Gandhi.  Who was Yakub Memon? Why is BJP attacking Uddhav Thackeray over the issue?  Let’s examine in detail:  Who was Yakub Memon?  Yakub Abdul Razzak Memon was the lone convict sentenced to death penalty in the 1993 Mumbai bombings case.  He was the third of six sons of Abdul Razzak Memon and the most educated of his family.  Yakub passed out of an English medium school and pursued a B. Com degree for higher education.  He later became a chartered accountant (CA) in 1990.  In 1991, Yakub, along with his childhood friend Chetan Mehta, set up ‘Mehta & Memon Associates’. A year later, Yakub opened his independent firm, ‘AR & Sons’, after the friends went their separate ways, as per IANS.  Explained Who was Yakub Memon whose beautified grave has made BJP train guns at Uddhav Thackeray Yakub Memon was one of the convicts in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case. PTI File Photo  Due to the success of his firm, Yakub was honoured with Best CA Award by the Memon community in Mumbai.  Soon he launched his company Tejrath International, which was involved in exporting meat and meat products to the Gulf and the West Asia,  Following his success as an entrepreneur, he invested in six flats in the Al-Hussaini Building in Mahim, near Mahim Dargah.  Yakub’s role in 1993 Bombay blasts  In the March of 1993, Bombay was rocked by 13 explosions that claimed 257 lives and injured more than 700.  The bombs went off at different sites in India’s financial capital with the first explosion at Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) around 1.25 pm. The other explosions happened in the Air India building, government offices, many hotels, banks, a bus, cinemas, two hospitals, a university and markets, BBC reported.  In January that year, Mumbai had witnessed Hindu-Muslim clashes, which killed 500 dead and led to around 40,000 people fleeing the city.  The key conspirators of the bombings were mafia don Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar and his close aide and Yakub’s brother Ibrahim ‘Tiger’ Memon.  Explained Who was Yakub Memon whose beautified grave has made BJP train guns at Uddhav Thackeray Fugitive don Dawood Ibrahim was behind the 1993 Mumbai bombings. AP File Photo  Just before the blasts, the Memon family had fled Mumbai on a flight to Dubai via Karachi. However, during the layover in Karachi, they had slipped out and entered Pakistan, as per The Wire.  In August 1994, Yakub was arrested in New Delhi along with six members of his family, including three women. Tiger and his other brother, Ayub, reportedly stayed in Pakistan.  Yakub was charged with aiding, abetting and felicitating a terrorist act. He was also found guilty of financing the operation through a co-accused Mulchand Shah and his firms, arranging flight tickets for Dubai and then Pakistan for six other accused in the case, IANS reported.  His other charges included criminal conspiracy, purchasing vehicles used in the blasts, possessing explosives with intent to endanger lives and illegal possession of arms and ammunitions.  A Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) court in Mumbai had gave him death penalty on 27 July 2007.  Despite his several appeals for mercy, Yakub was hanged 22 years after the 1993 blasts.  He was sent to the gallows at the Nagpur Central Jail before 7 am on 30 July, 2015, on his 53rd birthday.  The prime conspirators of the Mumbai blast, Tiger Memon and Dawood Ibrahim, remain out of India’s reach.  BJP trains guns at Uddhav Thackeray  The “beautification” of Yakub Memon’s grave has once again brought the dead convict front and centre in Indian politics.  The ruling BJP in Maharashtra has alleged that the Shiv Sena chief is behind Yakub’s embellished grave.  “The beautification of the terrorist’s grave took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. He (Thackeray) had no time for the common man and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government had helped with the beautification of the grave. This is one among many incidents, which exposed that Thackeray, had compromised with Hindutva to protect his position as chief minister,” Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekhar K Bawankule was quoted as saying by The Hindu.  The images from the south Mumbai cemetery, shared by BJP MLA Ram Kadam show LED lights and marble tiles around the grave. Slamming Uddhav, Ram Kadam claimed Yakub Memon’s grave was turned into a tomb during the Shiv Sena chief’s tenure as the chief minister.  “Is this their love for Mumbai, is this their patriotism? Uddhav Thackeray along with Sharad Pawar and Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the people of Mumbai,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.   Hitting back at the BJP, the Thackeray-led Shiv Sena said the entire row was to divert people’s attention from important issues such as inflation and unemployment.  Mumbai police removes LED lights  Following the controversy, the Mumbai police took off the LED lights around the grave of the terror convict.  A DCP-level police officer will investigate how the grave was beautified.   A police official told PTI that halogen lights were put up in the Bada Qabrastan during Badi Raat (Shab-e-Barat), adding that the Qabrastan trustees have removed the illumination.  The marble tiles around Yakub Memon’s grave were installed three years ago, the official added.

      "body": "New Delhi: Days after Madras High Court approved his elevation as AIADMK’s interim general secretary, Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday termed his rival O Panneerselvam as “chameleon” and accused him of betraying the party.  “OPS had led the violence at party HQ, how can the party cadre accept his return to the party? He has betrayed the party. OPS is like a chameleon,” said Palaniswami.   Palaniswami, popularly known as EPS, returned to the party headquarters today for the first time after his position as the single, supreme leader of AIADMK was strengthened by the Madras High Court order.   In a show of strength, hundreds of party workers, and elected MLAs and MPs gave Palaniswami a rousing reception as he paid tributes to the statues of the former Tamil Nadu chief ministers, MG Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa.  “Elections will be held soon for the post of party’s general secretary. Today, we entered the party headquarters and paid our respects to party leaders late MGR and late J Jayalalithaa,” he said.   On the party leadership dispute, the Madras High Court had on 2 September, allowed Palaniswami’s appeal and set aside an earlier order in favour of Panneerselvam.  A division bench comprising Justice M Duraiswamy and Justice Sundar Mohan set aside an order of a single judge, which nullified the 11 July General Council meeting of the AIADMK.  In that meeting held in July, leader of opposition EPS was elected as the interim general secretary of the party, the top post. Panneerselvam was ousted from the party.  O Panneerselvam, meanwhile, said the High Court verdict would be challenged in the Supreme Court.

      "body": "Ola Electric plans to launch its first electric car for India in the summer of 2024, according to CEO Bhavish Aggarwal. Amid the myriad of challenges, Aggarwal has pushed his electric car dream ahead, saying India needs to become the global epicentre of the EV revolution and command 25 per cent of the world’s automotive market.   EV penetration in the two-wheeler and passenger vehicle categories in India was 3.7 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively, in the second quarter (Q2 2022).  The first Ola electric car is likely to be a luxury crossover and the company will take a top-down approach into India’s electric car market. Bhavish Aggarwal, CEO, and Co-Founder of Ola Electric reportedly confirmed to PTI that the first electric car from the company would be priced between Rs. 40-50 lakh.  During the virtual launch event of Ola S1 on August 15, Ola announced that it will introduce its first electric car in 2024. It is claimed to arrive as one of the fastest cars in India and is said to go from 0-100kmph within 4 seconds.   It will have a range of over 500km on a single charge. Further, the EV will feature a glass roof and will run on the company's MoveOS software. It is also confirmed to include assisted driving capabilities, and keyless and handless doors.  Bhavish Aggarwal highlighted the EV startup’s interest in approaching the EV car segment in a top-down fashion. The startup intends to launch premium products first, followed by more affordable models.  “Ola’s product range will span Rs one lakh (entry two-wheelers) to Rs 40-50 lakh (premium electric car), and the company’s vision is to be a “global leader in mid-size, small and premium electric cars which are suitable for markets and consumers like India. The e-car will be the “fastest and sportiest” in India,” said Bhavish.  “We definitely have a full roadmap in the works in the car space. We will definitely have cars at the entry price market. We’re starting with a premium car that comes out in 18 to 24 months. We are envisioning across all the products (that) we will launch, maybe by 2026 or 2027 we will target a million cars a year by volume,” he added.",

Most of the car has been created new except the door mirrors. It rides on bespoke 22-inch alloys.   The new design showcases the development of the company’s design principles for its first BEV which is due in 2025 and other cars that will follow.  The Batur gets the most powerful engine a Bentley has ever got. The 6.0-litre W12 is an advanced twelve-cylinder engine.  As the W12 enters its twilight years as Bentley prepares for its electric revolution, it is upgraded with new turbochargers and intercoolers. The 6.0-litre W12 is an advanced twelve-cylinder engine which generates 719.59 bhp and 1,000 Nm of peak torque. The W12 is paired with Bentley’s eight-speed double-clutch transmission.  Inspired by the interior design of its predecessor Bacalar, the Batur builds on the core elements of Bacalar’s cabin design and adds new sustainable luxury features.   Customers also had the option of choosing from a range of sustainable interior materials such as tannage leather, low-carbon leather, and Dinamica, an alternative material to leather.

Bugatti has indicated that it intends the Mistral to become the world’s fastest roadster, a record currently held by the 427kph Hennessey Venom GT Spyder.  As sleek and cutting edge as the design of the Mistral is, a lot of the elements and creases that we see on the car are not merely for aesthetics, but aerodynamics.

Kochi, as of now, is the most advanced among all the charging stations with a capacity of 240kWh. Kia also mentioned that it will entertain Electronic Vehicles (EVs) from other Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). EV owners can use the charging facility on a pay per usage basis.  Speaking about Kia’s initiative to create a charging ecosystem, Myung-sik Sohn, Chief Sales Officer, Kia India, said, “These are exciting times for EVs, and we aim not just to be a part of mobility revolution of EVs in India but to make EV ownership aspirational, accessible, and inclusive,” reported Autocar.  Sohn elaborated that Kia’s EV journey in India “does not stop here.” Kia, with the setting up of charging stations, is aiming at improving customer experience by reducing charging time and range anxiety, which are some of the common aspects that drive people away from buying an electric vehicle.  Kia has also hinted at plans for manufacturing India-centric EVs by 2025. For now, the company has its EV6 trying to make a mark in the market.  The Kia EV6, on a full charge, offers a range of 528 kilometres.  Kia claims that the car can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in less than 20 minutes, if using a 350-kW charger.

Featuring some attractive cosmetic makeovers, the Honda Activa Premium is placed above the Activa DLX model, which is Rs 1,000 cheaper than the newly launched edition. The standard model of the Honda Activa 6G is Rs 3,000 cheaper than the premium model.  After months of wait, the manufacturer has finally launched the Honda Activa, which comes with more edge and curve to the overall look. The colour scheme, too, significantly contributes to the freshness of the premium edition. The scooter gets three new shades that will exclusively feature on Activa Premium. In addition, three mat colours – Mat Marshal, Mat Sangria, and Mat Pearl – are also available.  The logo on the scooter, along with the wheels, is sprayed in golden. The front fascia is also equipped with golden inserts that give the new edition its premium characteristics. Another feature that is painted golden is the name Activa written on the side. The footboard area and the seat are painted brown to give the scooter an overall dual-tone shade.  Coming to the engine specifications, the BS6 engine is immune to the alterations made to the Honda Activa Premium edition. The new premium edition features a 109.5-cc, air cooled, single-cylinder powertrain that manages to churn a maximum of 7.7bhp power at 8,000rpm and the torque peaks at 8.9Nm at 5,500rpm.  The braking system mated with the engine also remains the same. The front and the rear feature a 130mm drum brake. To utilise the power with maximum efficiency, Honda uses the CBS (Combined Braking System) technology.

Entering the Electronic Vehicle (EV) space as a new rival in town, the Mahindra all-electric XUV400 is expected to launch on 8 September, 2022, as per the reports.  The all-electric SUV will be based on the eXUV300 that was introduced by the manufacturer during the 2020 Auto Expo.  Although, the all-electric XUV400 is inspired by the eXUV300, hordes of modifications are expected to feature on the new Mahindra electric SUV.  Since the lower tax bracket policy does not apply to electric vehicles, the Mahindra XUV400 electric is expected to be roughly 4.3 metres in length, almost trumping the sub-4-metre rule.  Several other cosmetic aspects, including a closed front grille, integrated DRLs, and a reprofiled rear, will also help the EV stand out of its competitors.  Not much is revealed about the powerhouse of the vehicle but the Mahindra XUV400 might hone high-density NMC (Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt) cells which offer an extended driving range.  NMC Cells are a very popular option for solar storage equipment. With the use of the NMC cells, one can expect a range of 350-400 kilometres from the Mahindra XUV400.  This gives an edge to the Mahindra EV when compared to one of the biggest rivals in the market, the Tata Nexon EV, which offers a range of 312 kilometres. As per a report by Financial Express, the Mahindra XUV400 will be powered by a single motor, capable of churning out a maximum power of 150 bhp.  With the launch of the XUV400, Mahindra will kickstart the Mahindra Born Electric SUV campaign, which was unveiled on August. The vehicles under the concept will be designed at the Mahindra Advanced Design Europe (MADE) studio located in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom.  Coming to the price of the MahindraXUV400, the EV Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV) is expected to fall in the range of Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. The car will compete with the likes of Tata Nexon and MG ZS EV.  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The all-new Alto K10 is completely conceptualised, designed and made in India on Suzuki’s platform and drivetrain. The Alto K10 is longer than before and also offers a longer wheelbase. That translates into best in the segment rear legroom for the passengers. The new car gets a turning radius of 4.5-metres, which makes it very agile.  All four doors of the Alto now get speakers while the infotainment system is compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The instrument cluster gets a digital speedometer. There are dual airbags, ABS/EBD, rear parking assistance and more for stress-free and safe driving.",

      "body": "Bhavish Aggarwal, the founder and CEO of Ola has claimed that the range of its electric car will be more than 500 km, and it will accelerate from 0-100 km/hour in just four seconds.  Several automotive analysts, however, believe that the range of 500 km sounds too good to be true, especially if we consider the real-world range, which is often different from the range that has been calculated under ideal conditions in laboratory settings.  “It has taken years for legacy carmakers to get the battery technology just right,” said an analyst who works with all leading electric carmakers. “Launching your first electric car with a 500-km range sounds a bit too ambitious, unless, of course, the plan is to purchase long-range EV technology from abroad.” There are many a startup which have the tech but aren’t profitable, he added.  The range in an electric car is a function of the battery pack that is being used. A bigger battery pack will give you a longer range but it also increases the price of the car. “To reach 500 km and above range, a lot of other things need to be perfected, such as battery efficiency, getting the right lightweight material for the body shell without compromising safety, making the car less resistant to wind etc. and these things take time” the analyst added.  Possibly, that’s the reason even global cars being launched in India don’t have a range much above 500 km, even though some have battery packs twice the size of the Nexon EV Max.  Currently, the longest-range electric cars in India are the BMW i4 with a range of 590 km thanks to its 83.9 kWh battery, followed by the Kia EV6’s 528 km which comes courtesy of a 77.4 kWh battery.   The only mass-market electric car to have a range close to 500 km is the MG ZS EV, which has a range of 461kms, comes with a 50.3 kWh, and costs about Rs 25 lakh ex-showroom.  “Even though battery prices are coming cooling down globally, it’s difficult to offer a 500 km range electric car and price it competitively,” said the analyst.  According to Statista, the costs of lithium-ion battery packs in dollars-per-kilowatt-hour have halved from 2016 ($293 per kWh) to 2020 ($137 per kWh), and are expected to touch $101 by 2023. However, prices of various commodities and semiconductors are rising, effectively balancing out any drop in battery prices.  In addition, the driving range claimed by carmakers isn’t valid in the real-world driving because it is often calculated differently, under ideal conditions.  With that being said, the driving range of electric cars has been increasing, as carmakers are perfecting how to make the electric car more efficient, using technologies such as energy regeneration, designing cars and elements with better drag coefficients, using lightweight materials etc.  Mahindra’s five electric SUVs that will be developed on the purpose-built INGLO platform will definitely have a longer range than its existing electric cars such as the eVerito. Cars developed on Tata Motors’ born-electric pure EV architecture (such as the AVINYA concept car showcased earlier this year which will be launched in 2025) will have a real-world driving range of more than 500 km on a single charge.",

The two carmakers aim to make over one million units over the duration of their partnership and further explore possibilities of a broader strategic alliance to speed up electrification in India.  The deal was signed on Monday, when Mahindra unveiled its first five electric SUVs at an event held at the carmaker's new design studio in Banbury, United Kingdom. Rajesh Jejurikar, Executive Director of Auto and Farm Sectors at Mahindra and Mahindra, said, “Our vision is to lead the electric mobility revolution in India by bringing authentic electric SUVs with cutting-edge technology, as showcased in the UK today. We are very pleased to explore further areas of potential collaboration with Volkswagen and are confident that together, we will be able to shape an exciting electric future.”  Mahindra's new INGLO platform will power all five electric SUVs that were showcased on August 15. The platform offers batteries ranging between capacities of 60 kWh and 80 kWh, and support fast charging of up to 80 per cent in less than 30 minutes.   However, Mahindra did not specify the range these EVs will offer on a single charge. Volkswagen also aims to expand its relationship with Mahindra in the electric mobility sector, which will include several EV projects, local manufacturing of EV battery cells as well as EV charging infrastructure.   Volkswagen Group Board of Management member for Technology and CEO of Volkswagen Group Components, Thomas Schmall, said, “Together, Volkswagen and Mahindra can contribute significantly to the electrification of India, a huge automotive market with ambitious climate protection commitments. The MEB Electric Platform and its components are key to affordable sustainable mobility around the globe. The partnership not only demonstrates that our platform business is highly competitive, but also that the MEB is well on track to become one of the leading open platforms for e-mobility.”  With the new family of electric SUVs, Mahindra aims to take on Tata Motors in the EV space in India. Currently, Tata Motors dominates the segment with more than 80 per cent market share. Its Tata Nexon EV, which has three different models, is the best-selling electric car in the country.",

Not only did the Indian Army negotiators in Moldo-Chushul, near the Pangong tso (lake), did not agree, but also External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar reiterated several times that the relationship between India and China will be impacted if the latter disturbs peace and tranquility in border areas. “Our relationship is not normal, it cannot be normal as the border situation is not normal,” he told PTI recently in Bengaluru.  The minister added that the main issue with China is the border, where the Indian Army has been holding ground for two years. “The situation is tense as the positioning of the two armies is very close. It also could be a dangerous situation.”Beijing is also irritated with the Modi government because it has been more assertive on the Tibetan issue, for example by allowing the Dalai Lama to get a grand reception in Leh or providing all facilities (including an Indian Air Force helicopter to move around in the mountainous region) during his stay in Ladakh.  At the same time, India seems to be coming closer to the US, something which is not appreciated by China; Beijing is particularly resentful of a military drill which will take place from 18-31 October at an altitude of 10,000 feet in Uttarakhand’s Auli. The spokesman for the US Army in the Pacific explained: “The strategy for this year’s exercise focuses on cold-weather operations, and at high-altitude, an environment that poses distinct challenges.”  According to the Hindustan Times: “While the annual joint exercise ‘Yudh Abhyas’ is not new, the location and timing for this year’s drill are interesting, taking into consideration Beijing’s unprecedented exercise surrounding Taiwan in the past several days.”",

      "body": "The current floods in Pakistan are causing catastrophic destruction. More than 1,200 people have perished and one-third of the country is inundated with water. Immense damage has been caused to agricultural lands and standing crops. Infrastructure amounting to $10 billion has been destroyed. This natural disaster comes amid a complete disarray in the country’s politics over the past six months and a dire economic situation. The latter has led to skyrocketing inflation in fuel, power and food. The Pakistani rupee has fallen to all-time lows. And, in the wake of the floods the prices of vegetables such as onions and tomatoes have become unaffordable for the common man.  In such a situation it is the duty of the Pakistan government and also the institution which holds ultimate power in that country — the Army — to explore every opportunity to ameliorate the suffering of the masses. The obvious country to turn to for supplies of items of daily use is India. Indeed, while doing so Pakistan can also make it clear that it is doing so only for humanitarian reasons. That will be tantamount to implicitly claiming that its positions on the issues which divide the two countries remain the same. However, such is the depth of animus, enormous egos and feudal mindsets of its ruling civil and military elites that they would let their people suffer and live in deprivation than ask India for supplies.  The only rational voice heard on this issue over the past few days was that of Pakistan’s finance minister Miftah Ismail. He told the media on 29 August that Pakistan would consider importing vegetables and critically short food items from India because of the impact of the floods. Naturally, as Pakistan had closed the doors on imports from India, except for a few select items such as some pharmaceuticals, as part of the protest steps it took in the wake of the 5 August 2019 constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir, it is for its government to approach India on this matter. Some Pakistani media reports indicated that international aid agencies have also urged the country’s authorities to take a logical view in this matter.  The problem is that the Pakistani ruling elites have always abandoned logic and reason in their dealing with India. The only path that they have pursued is that of confrontation. They have also imbued the psyche of the Pakistani people with the narrative of India being an eternal enemy which has to be kept at bay through armed strength. This narrative is buttressed by the Islamic parties of the country which have a deep bias against India. Thus, even when popular welfare demands that Pakistan should turn to India to improve the condition of its people, its elites — civil, military and religious — ask their people for sacrifices.  ***  Explained: As floods wreak havoc in Pakistan, will India extend a helping hand?  ‘Pakistan facing monsoon on steroids,’ UN issues flash appeal amid devastating floods  Is climate change to blame for Pakistan’s flood fury?  ***  At the same time the elites seldom suffer from deprivation themselves. They live off the land and most of their children live and work abroad. Today, Imran Khan berates other political leaders for their foreign connections but he overlooks his own deep foreign connections. Indeed, do his sons live and work in Pakistan? They are both in their twenties and live abroad. Their mother was Khan’s first wife Jemima Goldsmith. The couple got divorced in 2004. It is also notable that even amidst these floods the vicious current political scene in Pakistan continues with Imran Khan seeking to score points over the Election Commission.  The mindset of the Pakistani elites towards their people, at this time of national crisis, is best illustrated by the answer on 30 August of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif to a question on trade with India for essential commodities needed by the country at this time. He said, “There won’t have been problems about trading with India but genocide is going on there and Kashmiris have been denied their rights. Kashmir has been forcibly annexed through the abolition of Article 370.”  Now, Shahbaz Sharif is otherwise a sober politician and is pragmatic but even he has had to follow the official toxic and inaccurate narrative against India. In this context though it has to be noted that when it comes to Kashmir the Sharifs, who trace their origin to it, have always maintained a very strong position. In fact, on occasion they have been more vehement in their comments on Kashmir than the Pakistan army. The difference between the Army and them on India has been this: The Army has wished to pursue an out and out negative approach towards India, but the Sharifs have generally wanted to pursue practical approaches on trade even while maintaining Pakistan’s traditional approaches on Kashmir.  Thus, on the trade front India has been adopting a correct approach at this time of floods in Pakistan; that it is for Pakistan to make the first move and ask for doors to open. The issue of an offer of humanitarian assistance to Pakistan in the shape of medicines, tents, clothes and food packets is more complex. On 29 August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, “Saddened to see the devastation caused by the floods in Pakistan. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, the injured and all those affected by this natural calamity and hope for an early restoration of normalcy”.  What was clearly missing was any offer of help in mitigating the impact of the floods. Responding to Modi’s message of sympathy, Shahbaz Sharif thanked Modi for his message and noted in a tweet: “With their characteristic resilience the people of Pakistan shall, InshaAllah, overcome the adverse effects of this natural calamity and rebuild their lives and communities.”  There was some speculation that India may offer assistance to Pakistan. Some sections of the Indian media also suggested that India should do so especially as India prides itself as being the first responder at times of natural calamities in the region. There was also a media report indicating that a debate was taking place within the government if it should offer help to Pakistan. A Ministry of External Affairs media briefing on 1 September stated that India was not contemplating such offers though sources claimed that India would not hesitate to allow international agencies to use Indian territory as transit to send aid to Pakistan.  In the past India and Pakistan have offered each other help at times of natural calamities. That Modi has not done so now is not surprising. The bilateral relationship is at a very ebb even if the ceasefire on the Line of Control and the International Border in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir has been holding. At the same time recent attempts at terrorist incidents across the IB have taken place. Thus, Modi simply cannot afford a situation where he sends humanitarian assistance and a Pakistan based terrorist group either by itself or organised by the Pakistani intelligence agencies undertakes a terrorist attack. The memory of the Pathankot terrorist attack which occurred within ten days of Modi’s 2015 Christmas day visit to Raiwind would be at the back of the mind of Indian decision makers.  The unfortunate fact is that the Pakistan Army has never allowed the normalisation of relations. It finished off prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s grand attempt in 1999 through its Kargil misadventure and it stymied Modi’s attempts through the Pathankot, Uri and Pulwama terrorist attacks. Unless the Pakistani people realise that it is their own Army which has always been the main stumbling block to their welfare and that their politicians act as the Army’s B team, they will continue to suffer.

To be a complete dictator, you’ve got to take control of everything. But the judiciary is still independent. There’s only one thing blocking his way, the independent judiciary. Now he wants to compromise that independence.”  “The time will come. We will have to find a way to put this man in his place.” “We cannot at the moment because he controls the law – what do you do with a man like that? But the time will come..”  Disruption to install the “prodigal son”  This is the despotism of Mahathir Mohamad that was unleashed upon the nation for 22 uninterrupted years till 2003. He then relented by handing over the reins to his Deputy, Abdollah Badawi. However, within a span of three years, Mahathir was back with his evil machinations to eliminate Badawi and to replace him with Najib Razak, the son of Malaysia’s second Prime Minister, in 2009. Then in 2013 Mahathir, who actually wanted his son to be set in line to inherit the Premiership, set upon to ouster Najib Razak.  The pathological lies and constant attack on Najib and the consequent pairing with a fractured opposition gave Mahathir a comeback platform under the guise of “reform” in 2018. This led to Mahathir having another 22-month stint as Prime Minister. During this 22-month stint, he re-aligned key institutions, namely the Attorney General’s Chambers, the Anti-Corruption Commission and most importantly, the Judiciary.  Musical chairs to further de-stabilise a nation  Malaysia, a rising Southeast Asian economy blessed with natural resources, has experienced severe economic lethargy since the re-emergence of this nonagenarian as the Prime Minister. From 2018 to the present time, Malaysia has played political musical chairs with unabated party-hopping instigated by Mahathir. This has resulted in Malaysia actually having three different governments headed by three separate Prime Ministers in a short span of four years.  Justice gone awry  While the 1MDB and SRC court proceedings of Najib Razak are well documented, they never really reflected the true substance of the judicial process.  Malaysia under siege  a despots continued machination Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. AFP  Najib was denied several basic defences enshrined in the constitution, namely:  1. Not having access to Zeti Akhtar’s, the governor of the Malaysian Central Bank, criminal investigations. This was the case highlighted by the Singapore authorities who had seized her family accounts in Singapore due to large payments received from Jho Low, the principal operator of 1MBD.  2. No actual criminal proceedings were undertaken on Nor Mohammad Yakub, the cabinet member under Najib’s administration who was principally involved with raising the required financing for 1MDB and who was also implicated by the Singapore authorities for payments received from Jho Low.  3. Justice Nazlan Ghazali, the judge who presided over Najib’s SRC trial and who initially sentenced him. Justice Nazlan was actually the legal advisor for the bank that oversaw the financial transaction on SRC. He was also later found to have been directly involved in the raising of funds for SRC through the bank and to also said to have received gratification(s) from Jho Low.  Despite a formal investigation conducted by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission on Justice Nazlan, and the overt media acknowledgement by the Attorney General, no-less, it was not admitted to Najib’s defence due to a later veiled retraction by the Attorney General himself.  Just to note, Justice Nazlan never recused himself from adjudicating on Najib’s case nor has he recanted.  4. Najib’s application for an outside counsel in January 2022, a Queen’s Council from the UK, was summarily dismissed by the Federal Court in July 20022, after 7 months, giving him very little time to re-organize his defence enshrined in the constitution.  5. In late July, having very little choice, Najib hired a fresh set of Malaysian lawyers who had expert advice from several senior Indian legal experts. These lawyers set upon to study voluminous documents. The size and depth of these documents was recently corroborated by the former Attorney General, Tommy Thomas in his latest interview in the Malaysian media.  On 15 August 2022, this new legal team representing Najib requested the Federal Court of Appeals, presided by the Chief Justice, for an extension of time to familiarise with the voluminous documents. This was summarily rejected by the Chief Justice. Najib’s legal team had no other option but to withdraw from the case leaving him unrepresented.  The Chief Justice pushed through the appeal and fast forwarded the judgment 3 days earlier than the set schedule.  6. Throughout the trial, several key personalities intimately involved with SRC were never produced in court, namely Jho Low and Nik Faisal (the CEO of SRC). Both of these individuals are believed to be absconding from Malaysia. Although, Wall Street Journal journalists who wrote the book “The Billion Dollar Whale” on Joh Low, have recently confirmed the sighting of Jho Low who is unabashedly enjoying life in China.  The hidden hand  Going forward, Malaysia is set to head for the polls shortly. This may become yet another watershed moment for Malaysia with Mahathir still playing a key part in manipulating the possible outcome. He is said to be a key advisor to the current Prime Minister, Ismail Sabri who is actually a compatriot of Najib and part of UMNO.  Ismail, is not seen as a heavy weight in any sense. He has not been able to move the nation out of its economic lethargy. On Mahathir’s advice, he refused to appoint Najib as an Economic Advisor. On Mahathir’s backing he has reneged on his commitment to give Najib a fair hearing. And, the latest is that, on Mahathir’s advice, he is trying to incarcerate all other UMNO leaders who may be a stumbling block for him to take on the party presidency.  All this is for Ismail, a relatively weak leader, to lead UMNO into the polls that may result in major fragmentation and fractures. This then gives Mahathir, at 97, to play the king maker in giving a life-line to Ismail and eventually place his prodigal son as the future Prime Minister of Malaysia.  Fear of the resurgence of Najib  Despite the gloomy and dismal outlook, Najib has actually applied for a royal pardon, something that is well enshrined in the constitution. This has resulted in numerous and constant jibes from this nonagenarian, the cluster of Malaysian left-liberal middle-class, and the opposition against the Royal Institutions per view. This can only mean this despot’s genuine fear of the resurrection of Najib with his popularity intact, or in actual sense, his growing popularity as exhibited by his Facebook following that has swelled from 230,000 to a staggering 4.6 million followers in just 10 days. There have been further support rallies from within UMNO and several other Malaysian Indian political personalities.  Time will tell. Najib’s ability to rise from this as the true Malaysian statesman may show us that the rule of law and justice in Malaysia are real and work despite the shenanigans of a despot. And, the words of the Tunku may yet come true….”  The time will come. We will have to find a way to put this man in his place.” “We cannot at the moment because he controls the law – what do you do with a man like that? But the time will come..”  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

      "body": "In the global economy roiled in turmoil, Bangladesh has become the third country in India’s neighbourhood to have sought help from IMF to cope with the mounting pressure on its economy. But time and time again, Bangladesh has shown resilience and has rebounded even stronger making its way among the fastest growing economies in the world. The ongoing visit of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh to India envisages to further strengthen bilateral ties, with the likely aim to initiate the talks for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.  How improved trade can further deepen IndiaBangladesh ties Prime Minister Narendra Modi shakes hand with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina during her ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan on 6 September 2022. AP  Trade ties  In 2021, India was the 2nd largest import source and 7th largest export destination for Bangladesh. In 2021, the bilateral trade increased by almost 80 per cent, estimated at $15.9 billion in 2021, however accounting for less than 2 per cent of total trade of India and 12 per cent of Bangladesh’s total trade. There lies an untapped trade potential of $5.1 billion between India and Bangladesh.  Bangladesh’s import demand aligns with India’s export capabilities, offering high trade complementarity between the two South Asian economies. Bangladesh’s major import items like cotton, mineral fuel, machinery, electrical equipment, and cereals are among the top exported commodities by India to the world. India shares longest land border with Bangladesh surrounding it from all three sides, making India a natural trade partner of Bangladesh. Yet India accounts for only 19 per cent of the total imports of Bangladesh after China, while USA is the largest export destination even with no GSP and no land borders.  Increased trade and transport cost between India and Bangladesh act as hinderance in cross border trade. Lack of transport integration is an important factor to the high trade costs between the two countries. Since the major portion of trade between India and Bangladesh happens through land, trade costs are mainly determined by the time taken for goods to cross the border. According to World Bank report, it takes 138 hours for a shipment to cross the border at ICP Petrapole, which is the largest land port in South Asia and accounts for nearly 30% of land-based trade between India and Bangladesh. When Indian trucks reach the border, the goods are completely unloaded and then reloaded on Bangladeshi trucks, which alone take 28 hours.  Additionally, there are issues relating to customs and immigration clearances. High tariffs and non-tariff barriers have contributed to the existing high cost of trading goods. India provides duty-free access to imports from Bangladesh for all products except tobacco and alcohol under the agreement on the South Asian Free Trade Area, but Bangladesh still maintains a long sensitive list for imports. India imposes on an average 0.4 per cent import tariff on Bangladeshi goods while Bangladesh imposes on an average 7.8 per cent of import tariff on Indian goods, as per WITS database of World Bank. India however has in place a number of NTBs majorly through Sanitary and Phytosanitary and Technical Barriers to Trade on Bangladeshi goods. Consequently, these tariff and non-tariff barriers are envisaged to come down in case of a trade agreement. This will prove to be in the mutual interest of both Bangladesh and India especially for the northeast region of India.

      "body": "In the global economy roiled in turmoil, Bangladesh has become the third country in India’s neighbourhood to have sought help from IMF to cope with the mounting pressure on its economy. But time and time again, Bangladesh has shown resilience and has rebounded even stronger making its way among the fastest growing economies in the world. The ongoing visit of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh to India envisages to further strengthen bilateral ties, with the likely aim to initiate the talks for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.  How improved trade can further deepen IndiaBangladesh ties Prime Minister Narendra Modi shakes hand with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina during her ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan on 6 September 2022. AP  Trade ties  In 2021, India was the 2nd largest import source and 7th largest export destination for Bangladesh. In 2021, the bilateral trade increased by almost 80 per cent, estimated at $15.9 billion in 2021, however accounting for less than 2 per cent of total trade of India and 12 per cent of Bangladesh’s total trade. There lies an untapped trade potential of $5.1 billion between India and Bangladesh.  Bangladesh’s import demand aligns with India’s export capabilities, offering high trade complementarity between the two South Asian economies. Bangladesh’s major import items like cotton, mineral fuel, machinery, electrical equipment, and cereals are among the top exported commodities by India to the world. India shares longest land border with Bangladesh surrounding it from all three sides, making India a natural trade partner of Bangladesh. Yet India accounts for only 19 per cent of the total imports of Bangladesh after China, while USA is the largest export destination even with no GSP and no land borders.  Increased trade and transport cost between India and Bangladesh act as hinderance in cross border trade. Lack of transport integration is an important factor to the high trade costs between the two countries. Since the major portion of trade between India and Bangladesh happens through land, trade costs are mainly determined by the time taken for goods to cross the border. According to World Bank report, it takes 138 hours for a shipment to cross the border at ICP Petrapole, which is the largest land port in South Asia and accounts for nearly 30% of land-based trade between India and Bangladesh. When Indian trucks reach the border, the goods are completely unloaded and then reloaded on Bangladeshi trucks, which alone take 28 hours.  Additionally, there are issues relating to customs and immigration clearances. High tariffs and non-tariff barriers have contributed to the existing high cost of trading goods. India provides duty-free access to imports from Bangladesh for all products except tobacco and alcohol under the agreement on the South Asian Free Trade Area, but Bangladesh still maintains a long sensitive list for imports. India imposes on an average 0.4 per cent import tariff on Bangladeshi goods while Bangladesh imposes on an average 7.8 per cent of import tariff on Indian goods, as per WITS database of World Bank. India however has in place a number of NTBs majorly through Sanitary and Phytosanitary and Technical Barriers to Trade on Bangladeshi goods. Consequently, these tariff and non-tariff barriers are envisaged to come down in case of a trade agreement. This will prove to be in the mutual interest of both Bangladesh and India especially for the northeast region of India.

      "body": "Several very important things became obvious at the ongoing Vladivostok economic forum (ends on 8 September). That annual gathering has always been a venue for anyone interested in the “Asian angle” of the future trends of global economy. This time the people attending and watching that Vladivostok event have discovered, that Asia may become even more lucky in the nearest decade, than it was previously imagined. It’s mostly about energy, since that is something basic for any economy.  Conferences are always a PR event, they are about making certain facts and figures very public, especially if you sign some big energy contracts right there, in the spotlight of attention.  So, it was at Vladivostok where certain facts about India and Russian oil became very, very public. Prime Minister Narendra Modi have sent greetings to the attendees, noting great prospects in energy cooperation with Russia. He also stressed India’s interest in Russian coal for Indian metallurgy, as well as in pharmaceutics and hi-tech.  Almost anyone attending the forum knew the meaning of these words. Russia has rapidly risen to the position of India’s second oil supplier, next after Iraq, with oil imports from Russia rising 50 (fifty) – fold since April. Some Indian attendees of the forum were talking about all kind of trade between two nations rising fast, spurred on by a new model of payments, rupees to rubles, avoiding dollar settlements.  It’s all about the war, of course. For some, it’s a local war between Russia and Ukraine, the latter supported by all that’s the West. For others, it’s a global war of the West against Russia and China, with miserable Ukraine chosen as a proxy and a victim of that process, with a view on Taiwan playing the same role.  That war is mainly conducted with so-called economic sanctions against Russia, meant to ruin its economy. The result, if you look at the big picture, is surprising. The West has sanctioned itself, refusing to buy Russia’s oil and gas. The global spot prices for these commodities went up uncontrollably, up to 10 times compared to the previous figures, or more.  So, as a result, Russia’s Asian partners are getting their energy much cheaper than their Western colleagues. Which makes their production suddenly extremely competitive, while the problem is, that the buyers of that production, especially in Europe, have suddenly become very poor, and price-conscious, and nervous. That’s the basic shape of the world to come, for the nearest decade at least.  So it’s small surprise that the main highlight of the conference were two announcements concerning energy supplies to China. The first is an addition to an earlier contract between China’s CNPC and Russia’s Gazprom about pipeline gas deliveries on the “Siberian Power” route, saying that the payments will be made in rubles and yuans on the 50-50 basis. The second announcement is about the future gas line to China, across Mongolia, being basically agreed upon on everything, prices including.  So China will have more guaranteed cheap gas for decades to come, while Russian banks have already started lending programmes in yuans, with the US dollar losing even more ground in global settlements.  The Vladivostok forum started in 2015 as a local event, it was mostly about attracting investors to a neglected area of Russia, since most business people at the time were crossing the Siberian spaces to reach the big cities in Russia’s Europe. Now the forum is something else. Enough is to say that this time it has been attended by people from 90 nations, including Americans, Europeans and other Westerners. With all respect to venues like APEC or G20 with their oncoming summits, so far it’s in Vladivostok where one simple idea has become obvious.  That idea is, that the war the West has started against Russia and China has not only strengthened at least Russia, but it has given unexpected future advantages to Asia in general. And, obviously, that’s how Russia is becoming a very important mainstay of Asian economy.  I would not be too sure to say that the top people in Moscow anticipated anything of this. They may have mostly concentrated on withstanding the first blow to Russia’s economy, that was supposed to blast the nation in March, right after the hostilities started in Ukraine in late February. But in reality Russia’s leaders watched, with total amazement, how sanctions against their country began to murder the Western and global economy, without really hurting Moscow.  That tired amazement was manifest in the speech of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, in Vladivostok. The speech was mostly technical, Putin was quoting figures, mentioning small economic facts, while political-minded folks like me mostly waited for something important, on global scope, to be pronounced.  But what he said about things global, was bordering on the obvious. First, it’s about Western leaders’ stubborn inability to accept the facts about the West not being all-powerful. It’s that inability that could well be named as the main reason of Asia-Pacific becoming stronger “by default”.  Second, the Russian president noted the fact that, at first, after the start of the war, a lot of Western corporations were announcing their departure from Russia. But the first result of it, so far, is closure of their business at least in Europe.  Third, nobody expected the Western financial system to become a big question mark, after it was used as a weapon of war against Russia. But now we all have discovered that rupees and yuans are money, too, and good money at that.  The overall picture of the current global confrontation is puzzling – here I have to stray from my main Vladivostok topic. We, Russia, have spent decades fearing the West, hating the West, envying the West, admiring the West… You may very well call it a colonial mentality. And now we see that terrible and wonderful West hurting itself while trying to hurt us, not to mention its moral demise. Isn’t it a very Indian situation of, say, late 30-s and 40-s?

      "body": "The recent allegations of Operation Lotus by the Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal are strategic moves ahead of the Gujarat and Himachal elections. While this will sideline the debate on the alleged irregularities of the Delhi Excise Policy, for which Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia faced a CBI probe, it will also help the party to shift focus from the debate on the negative impact of the freebie schemes.  Within 48 hours of the probe, Sisodia came up with the allegations that the BJP had contacted him and offered him the chief minister’s post if he shifted the party. He also claimed that the BJP had offered him money. Thereafter, several AAP MLAs also claimed the same. With a high voltage drama, Kejriwal paraded all the MLAs at the Rajghat. He did not stop there. Kejriwal brought a confidence motion in the Delhi Assembly and passed it. Significantly, the Deputy Speaker of the house suspended all the BJP MLAs and only AAP MLAs were present during the confidence motion.  This high voltage drama is not only propaganda against the claims of the BJP, but also to utilize this probe against the party as a political weapon to counter the BJP in the upcoming Assembly elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. According to the sources in the party, the AAP is already re-strategizing the campaigns in the poll-bound states.  Attempt to go beyond freebies  The AAP party is fighting the upcoming elections based on its governance model in Delhi and Punjab. The basis of this is a number of freebies which the party claims as free welfare schemes. Kejriwal has already announced free electricity, free water, free education, free healthcare and a monthly allowance of Rs 1,000 for women in Gujarat. The BJP has come down heavily against these freebies. Significantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself slammed the freebie politics. However, Kejriwal and AAP have not shown any sign of stopping from the announcements of freebies.  Senior AAP leaders opined that as the freebie debate is under the scrutiny of the Supreme Court the party wanted a plan B to counter the BJP. “People of Gujarat are showing positive response to the AAP. The welfare schemes of the party are our base but we do not know what the judgment on the matter will be,” said a senior AAP functionary who is looking after the Gujarat campaign on the condition of anonymity.  He also said that Kejriwal will visit Gujarat soon and tell the people how the BJP falsely charged Sisodia in the excise policy and tried to topple the government.  ***  Also Read  Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to attend conclave of sarpanches on final day of Gujarat visit  Gujarat: Arvind Kejriwal out to break the bank for vote bank, promises farm loan waiver equal to half of state’s income  AAP vote share in Gujarat up by 4 per cent post CBI raid on Sisodia, will rise to 6 per cent if he’s held: Kejriwal  After CBI, ED has also given clean chit to Manish Sisodia, says AAP; agency yet to respond  ***  Significantly, according to media reports during a recent press conference when reporters asked AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj about the proof of the allegations of Operation Lotus, he said, “Lord Ram used brahmastra when it was required. I assure you that we will definitely use brahmhastra where it is needed.”  Party sources said that the AAP is likely to hold a mega expose at the peak of the Gujarat campaign where Kejriwal is likely to present the proof of Operation Lotus. AAP sources said that the party has audio recordings of the conversation between MLAs and the BJP leaders.  Portrayal of repression on education model  The party sources confirmed that along with the allegations of Operation Lotus, the AAP will also tell people how the BJP tried to stop their education model in Delhi.  Recently the New York Times newspaper carried a front-page story depicting the good works of Manish Sisodia and the AAP government in the education sector. The Aam Aadmi Party leaders alleged that the next day CBI raided the residence of Sisodia.  A senior AAP leader who did not want to be named said, “The entire attack on the Aam Aadmi Party is because of the success of our education model. In Gujarat and Himachal we have been telling the people about this success. However, now it is time we should go and tell the people of these states how the Bharatiya Janata Party put false cases against our leadership due to our work in education.”  Significantly, the Aam Aadmi Party leaders also asserted that in both the states the campaign will also include how the Congress party was the first one to support the CBI raids against Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain.  In both Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh for years the fight has been between the BJP and the Congress. The Aam Aadmi Party is trying to get vacant space due to the decline of the year-old party.  Meanwhile, amid the row over the excise policy Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Vinai Kumar Saxena has asked the chief secretary to probe how student enrolment declined significantly despite the hike in the education budget. The LG also put the school classroom construction by the Delhi government under his scrutiny last week.  Kejriwal’s sympathy bet  Arvind Kejriwal likes to play on the victim card or sympathy card. During the Delhi and Punjab assembly elections, he found some comments by the BJP leaders where they either told Kejriwal a “terrorist” or has connections with the terrorists. He rampantly used this to gain support.  Unlike the Bharatiya Janata party which fights on the charisma of Prime Minister Modi, their ideology of nationalism and Hindutva majority of the regional parties try to gain sympathy by playing victim cards. Recently the Congress party tried to gain the sympathy of the people through repeated dharnas and rallies when the enforcement directorate questioned party president Sonia Gandhi and his son Rahul Gandhi.  Mamata Banerjee, the TMC supremo and chief minister of Bengal, claimed that saffron party thugs attacked her car and broke her leg during the 2021 Bengal Assembly elections. In a wheelchair, she managed the entire election campaign.  According to Aam Aadmi Party sources, Kejriwal will likely ask Gujarat and Himachal voters whether they think he and party members like Manish Sisodia and Satyender Jain are thieves or not. He did the same in Punjab and Delhi with the terrorist jibes against him.  An AAP Gujarat functionary said, “You call it a sympathy card or victim card, we call it telling the truth to the people. The entire attack on the AAP happened because of our good work in Delhi and now in Punjab. The party which maintains the highest regard for honesty are being labelled as corrupt. Janata apana bhagvaana che (people are our god).”  Putting AAP ahead of Congress  The key battle in the state of Gujarat and Himachal has always been between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress party. But now with time, the congress party has been suffering from a massive decline in the states. This is not a new story; the party is in a poor condition across India. The Aam Aadmi Party, the AIMIM and other political parties are trying to capture this space.  In Gujarat and Himachal, the Congress party is in such a condition that they do not have much political message to provide. According to a significant section of political observers, the Congress party will only be busy keeping its flock together until the election.  Whereas, the Aam Aadmi Party has a clear political message. While the key focus of the party will be the freebies, with the recent CBI probe and excise policy row the AAP will gain momentum in terms of political messaging. This will indeed help the party.  Shifting focus from excise policy  It is significant to note that the Aam Aadmi Party is not talking about the issue of alleged irregularities in the excise policy. From the time of the CBI raid, the AAP has been talking about how they are victimised due to their good works in the sectors of education and health.  According to the sources in the party, the key focus or strategy of the Aam Aadmi Party in the upcoming elections and also in Delhi and Punjab is to talk about the harassment done by the Bharatiya Janata party and not on the issue of the excise policy. While the Aam Aadmi Party leaders have claimed that there are no irregularities in this policy, there is a belief that the party cannot afford to focus on the details of corruption allegations.  The ultimate goal right now of the AAP is to bring on a Modi vs Kejriwal debate. But there is no doubt that the allegations of corruption hurt the party the most. And it is evident from the recent row. Arvind Kejriwal has been doing this high voltage perception building from the day of the CBI raid at Sisodia’s residence. It is also pertinent to note that the CBI FIR on the excise policy not only targets Manish Sisodia but also names people like Vijay Nair who is claimed to be the key brain behind Kejriwal’s campaigns and strategies. Therefore, less discussion on excise row is the best for the AAP.

      "body": "Design thinking essentially helps a creative streamline their thought process and create a system that they can work with. It’s an extremely important process that every designer should apply to their skill set. As a creative, when you create a product or service for a client, understanding their needs should be a priority. In order to do so, you should be able to empathise with your audience and keep their emotions in mind. A design evokes feelings which encourage the customer to buy the product or service. Of course, functionality and practicality play an integral role as well, however the first look is where the emotion lies.  There are five main non-linear stages in design thinking — Empathising, Defining an Audience, Ideating, Prototyping and Testing. Once you clear all stages, you can come up with a core strategy for your client that is well-thought out, innovative and structured. Once you create a process for yourself that is based on the principles of design thinking, you can create a flow that starts to work for itself.  As a process, design thinking is applicable to all creatives, whether they work individually or with teams. Not only does it help streamline your workflow, it also helps you solve problems better when it comes to working with clients who are either seeking help for their product or service.  A process that takes into account both qualitative and quantitative data, design thinking creates a holistic approach to creating a problem-solving mechanism. It’s a “user first” thought process. Starting with vague ideas and then supporting them with data that is analysed well, as a creative you can understand both sides of the coin and support your solution with rational discoveries.  The stages mentioned below are non-linear and can be rearranged in order to reach the final outcome.  Empathising: This is the first step ideally to outline the user’s needs. This stage can be used as the starting point to help you start the process. Create a broad list of who your user is and what their needs are. Defining the Audience: Once you have narrowed down the user’s needs, this stage helps you funnel the problems they are facing. Ideating: Ideating can be considered as a brainstorming stage where you get creative to formulate solutions based on the data collected on the core user group. This stage should be discussed and researched at length. Once you make a mind map of what the solutions could be to the problems that need to be addressed, creative solutions can start to be the bridge between ideas and prototyping. Prototyping: As the name suggests, this stage involves working on multiple iterations based on the ideas you have shortlisted, that need to be experimented with. Only then will this stage break away from following a certain roadmap, it’ll construct and reconstruct ideas and processes until an outcome is nailed-down. Testing: This is a very interesting and feedback-based stage where you don’t just collect quantitative data based on the user’s reaction, you also receive feedback as to what the user thinks about the solution. Users are an integral part of the process, they help you understand the main “why” which the entire process is based on. Using the feedback received from the testing stage, creatives can go back to the drawing board to better formulate their theory. Design thinking is a simple approach that can help creatives develop a strategy that solidifies their thought process. Being a multi-staged process, you can break down your actions and take control of the solution you intend on offering the user.  Keeping the user and their problems at the centre, you need to conceptualise, create prototypes and finally actualise. This creative approach will not just help you understand how users think and behave, it’ll also help you stand outside the box and think in a non-linear manner to come up with multi-faceted solutions.

We never learn. The motley crew of eternal optimists, ‘Aman ki Asha’ brigade, ‘South Asianists’, spin doctors and ‘syncretic ethos’ peddlers in India need periodic reality checks. There is no place for a bleeding-heart policy on Pakistan — a nation whose very existence was conceptualized on anti-Indianness and that vows to wage eternal war against India.  Pakistan aims to dismember India in the north and in the west and yet, despite a thousand cuts, we still haven’t gotten over our penchant for fighting terrorism with idealism. Here’s the hard truth, the amorality of which makes liberals pinch their nose: the more Pakistan suffers from economic and political destabilisation, the better it is for India’s security environment.  That is not to say that we don’t sympathize with the millions in Pakistan who are suffering from the twin shocks of a brutal natural calamity and a bankrupt Pakistan state’s incompetence and apathy. We do. And we are ready to help. The situation in Pakistan is grim. Its Sindh province has received 466 per cent more rain than average, triggering a cataclysmic chain of events that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,200 people, displacement of 33 million people and at least $10 billion worth of economic damage.  According to a Reuters report, 1.6 million houses, 5,735 km (3,564 miles) of transport links, 750,000 head of livestock, and more than 2 million acres (809,370 hectares) of farmland have been swept away. “It is water everywhere as far as you could see. It is just like a sea,” says Shehbaz Sharif, the beleaguered prime minister of Pakistan.  Prime minister Narendra Modi extended India’s “heartfelt condolences” to the families of victims and those affected by the floods. Various international aid agencies fighting to restore a semblance of normalcy in Pakistan have called for a relaxation on imports from India to fight a grave food crisis, and for a moment it seemed Islamabad would allow better sense to prevail.  Pakistan’s finance minister, Wharton-graduate economist Miftah Ismail who wants the nation to “live within its means” told local media last month that Pakistan is mulling importing vegetables and other essential edible items from India. With crop-producing provinces such as Baluchistan, Sindh and parts of Punjab badly affected by floods, vegetable prices underwent a 500 per cent appreciation, putting tomatoes, potatoes and onions out of common people’s reach. Importing essentials from India to mitigate the crisis should have been a no-brainer.  Yet, in a measure of Pakistan’s sheer delusion and perverse incentive framework, no sooner did Ismail make the comments that Sharif shot down the suggestion of his Cabinet colleague, telling media that “there won’t have been problems about trading with India, but genocide is going on there and Kashmiris have been denied their rights”, and that he’s “ready to sit and talk with Modi” on Kashmir.  Despite being subjected to such barbs, India refused to take the bait. In an indication of its commitment towards Neighbourhood First policy and credibility as a first responder in regional crisis, New Delhi let it be known through official channels that its offer of aid still stands, and it is ready to send pre-cooked meals, tents, medical supplies, and rubber boots as part of relief material.  A Business Standard report published on 4 September notes that “while foreign ministry officials of both nations were initially in touch, Pakistan has maintained zero communication on the subject”. The report goes on to quote MEA officials, as saying “the issue has become hostage to Islamabad’s political calculations. As of now, we don’t see much movement on the matter as it stands.”  This was confirmed by Islamabad that made it clear that imports from India are “not under consideration.” So there.  What are these ‘political calculations’ that prevent Pakistan from taking India’s help even when it is in dire straits? Pakistan — that feels hemmed in and squeezed out of options by the change effected by the Modi government in the constitutional status of Kashmir in 2019 — desperately wants to force India back to the dialogue table. In absence of any real leverage to do so, and increasingly imperiled further by its collapsing economy, the last thing that the harassed Sharif government wants is to appear “soft” on India. It would open one more avenue for a marauding Imran Khan to exploit.  Bruised, battered and pauperised by the floods, Pakistan still refused to accept aid from India or to even temporarily relax trade curbs because it fears that these steps may be interpreted as a normalization of India’s move on Kashmir.  That hasn’t stopped a section of Indian media, however, from virtue-signaling and displaying cherubic naivete. Solemn editorials call for both “New Delhi and Islamabad” to “put aside their domestic considerations, and seize the moment” because “it would be both tragic and ridiculous if the enmity between the two countries would not allow them to work together at a time such as this.” Some call for resumption of dialogue. Some perceive a “thaw” in bilateral ties.  Pressing India to help a country that stubbornly refuses our help is a strange affliction. New Delhi has offered sympathies and indicated that it is ready to assist, but the call must be taken by Islamabad. It can’t be helped if Pakistan chooses delusion over rationality. All that the cries for unsolicited help do, is send across a message of weakness — that the Indian state is soft and incapable of holding on to its red lines. Milk of human kindness won’t make Pakistan change its attitude or policy on Kashmir.  This ties to a larger point on Pakistan that, despite the facts on the ground, causes willful blindness among some Indians forever hopeful of a resumption of “normalcy” and of getting rejoined at the hip. There is no point talking with Pakistan. No amount of concession or rational engagement will change the equation or nudge it towards a reasonable posture because unlike our approach to the bilateral relationship that is predicated on peaceful coexistence, resumption of trade and other ordinary facets of ties, Pakistan’s gaze is revanchist, driven by a pathological need to dismember India and acquire Kashmir. It has taken India decades and several wars to come to terms with this asymmetric threat perception.  It will be a strategic failure on India’s part to look at bilateral ties through a moral prism. Pakistan might be in trouble but both in ideology and praxis it is led by an animus towards India that governs all its actions. To wish for stability in Pakistan or to attempt a move towards normalcy in ties through a conciliatory posture is to aid an intractable adversary. It is detrimental to our security, political and geopolitical interests. It is also a moral (as well as a strategic) failure because the state’s raj dharma and primary duty is towards the well-being and protection of its citizens — not pursue mythical mollification of a terror-sponsoring state.  Besides, we need not be driven by moral compunctions because bankrupt coffers and perilous state of existence notwithstanding, Pakistan has mastered the ‘boom-bust’ cycle, living off loan to loan, which Sharif euphemistically calls “characteristic reliance”. Its flip-flop behavior on trade with India, too, fits a pattern. This pattern, in turn, indicates increasing domestic instability and an intensification of civil-military and even intra-military discord.  In March 2021, when Imran Khan was still in power, a panel called ‘Economic Coordination Committee’ of the Khan cabinet decided to import sugar, cotton and cotton yarn from across the border through land and sea routes, in a move that was touted as revival of trade ties. It took just one day for Khan, who had presided over the earlier meeting that approved the import, to do a complete U-turn and declare that trade with India “could not resume and relations could not normalize” unless Kashmir “got back its constitutional status and the Kashmiris were granted their right to self-determination.”  Clearly, something happened within that 24 hours beyond a comical volte-face. Analyst Sushant Sareen of ORF posited that it is possible “that the army, or at least Bajwa’s cabal within the military, was open to, and even pushed for opening up some trade with India…” Sareen puts the abortion of the move to either “some very powerful section within the army” going against it, or even Khan defying Bajwa.  A year on, that rivalry has intensified. Khan has been ousted from power, and he has declared war against the Bajwa faction of the military. The former prime minister has portrayed the Sharif-led coalition government as ‘western stooge’ and has successfully tapped into the popular discontent fueled by a failing economy, soaring inflation and deep suffering inflicted by Pakistan’s worst flood in decades. As Khan’s popularity soars and his party wins key by-elections — the army’s iron grip over Pakistan’s polity has come under unprecedented challenge.  Bloomberg reports that retired army officials have attended pro-Khan rallies in recent months and there are “signs that Khan still retains plenty of silent allies in the military even if he’s fallen out of favor with the army chief, Bajwa.”  Pakistan is now plagued with profound economic woes that has led to political instability, and civil-military friction. It is reaping the harvest of a neurotic fixation with an expansive geopolitical agenda involving Afghanistan and Kashmir to gain power parity with India at the cost of economic growth and development. The powerful military, which still enjoys outsized influence over elected governments and polity, has seen its influence steadily erode at not being able to deliver either Kashmir or prosperity.  As C Raja Mohan writes in Indian Express, “India’s transformed relations with the US, the resolution of Delhi’s dispute with the global nuclear order, and getting the West to discard its temptation to mediate on Kashmir enormously improved India’s diplomatic position. But the most consequential change has been in the economic domain… If India has inched its way into the top six global economies, Pakistan today is broke.”  The depth of Pakistan’s bankruptcy is stunning. The nation, which recently received a funds infusion of $1.1 billion under an IMF programme — part of a $7 billion assistance package — has seen a surge in external debt obligations with repayments this fiscal rising to $24 billion from about $14 billion two years ago. This, coupled with its fast-depleting forex reserves that fell 6.6 per cent on a weekly basis to $7.83 billion in August 2022, lowest since 2019 places the country’s finances in a precarious position. Pakistan has been further hamstrung by devastating floods that seen price gains at 47-year high and a damage repair bill of $10 billion. Drowning in debt, Pakistan will now find it even harder to implement the unpopular austerity measures that accompany IMF assistance.  The combined effect of these factors has meant that Pakistan’s hand against India has been considerably weakened. Sustained economic growth has enabled India to move up the global power ladder and garner concomitant geopolitical clout, while Pakistan’s anemic growth has robbed it of the muscle to back its own geopolitical agenda. External variables have aided this trajectory, but the core difference lies in the economic domain.  This is a desired end state for India when it comes to managing the Pakistan challenge because a weak, disjointed, and penniless Pakistan will find it increasingly difficult to fund terror. India has been able to raise the costs for Pakistan to use terror as a state policy, and the FATF mechanism has put further constraints on Pakistan’s terror-financing tactics. Its assertive posture on Kashmir may never become less strident but Pakistan will face a perilous choice in reallocating meagre resources to pursuing nefarious agendas inside India.  That said, it must be noted that despite its inherent weaknesses, Pakistan will not be allowed to fail. One, it has learnt to monetise its “too dangerous to fail” myth that still sells well in the West — enabling a steady line of credit. The failed state will keep getting enough incentive to keep failing. Second, is has become adept at managing what scholar C Christine Fair calls ‘a very stable instability’.  Fair points out in Foreign Policy that “Pakistan emerged from the 1971 war stronger and more capable of projecting its interests despite the loss of half of its population, precious natural resources, and considerable landmass. Moreover, Pakistan has survived the most grievous of natural disasters without any of the predicted adverse second-order effects. It’s time to put to rest the idea that Pakistan will collapse—or fears collapsing.”  Additionally, a host of actors — among which some are India’s strategic rivals — are deeply invested in Pakistan’s survival and its ability to balance India. China, for instance, sees Pakistan as a low-cost option to tie down India in South Asia and work on India’s faultlines that Pakistan is uniquely placed to exploit.  Yun Sun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Center think-tank in Washington, writes in War on the Rocks that the delicate balance of power between India and Pakistan increasingly getting skewed in favour of New Delhi hasn’t escaped Beijing’s attention.  “If Pakistan is no longer able to act as China’s balancer of India in South Asia, China’s most direct remedy is the strengthening of Pakistan’s power… However, if that strategy is not successful in the near future, China could step in with more direct involvement in the form of further security assistance.”  The CEO of Baykar Technology, Turkey’s top armed drone manufacturing company whose armed drones have served Ukraine well in its fight against Russia, recently told Nikkei Asia newspaper that while it sells its TB2 drones to 23 countries around the world including Pakistan, it shall never sell these devices to India, because “our priority is to share our capabilities with brotherly countries that we have strategic relations with” such as Pakistan.  And then there’s the United States. The Joe Biden administration announced on Wednesday that reversing a Donald Trump-era decision, it has approved a $450 million F-16 fighter jet fleet upgradement programme to Pakistan, its “important counterterrorism partner”. Analysts say advanced radar and missile capabilities of the nuclear-capable F-16 fleet will give Pakistan an edge over India. Washington’s move to arm a terror state raises fresh questions on US reliability.  The timing of the announcement has also raised speculation that this was a ‘reward’ for Pakistan making available its airspace for the Biden administration to take out Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was lodged in a safe house in Kabul.  Pakistan has and will survive by exploiting its indispensability — be it strategic rivalry, its role as balancer of India, brotherhood of ummah or as a provider of access to Central Asia, and even in its perilous existence and weakened diplomatic position, it will retain the ability to make life difficult for India.  It is evident that there is no place for a bleeding-heart policy when it comes to Pakistan. India must work towards widening the economic chasm and power gap with Pakistan and force a gradual change in Islamabad’s terms of engagement.

      "body": "he heartthrob of the nation Ranbir Kapoor, who is considered as one of the most versatile actors of this generation, is currently gearing up for the release of his biggie Brahmastra, which is set to hit the screens tomorrow.  While the trailer and songs have garnered tremendous response from the audience, a certain section is spreading negativity about the film and trending #BoycottBrahmastra like other Bollywood movies on social media.  Despite the film has been continuously getting targeted by trolls, Brahmastra has registered great numbers in its advance booking reports and is expected to surpass the numbers of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 (Rs 14.11 crore) to become the biggest Bollywood opener of 2022.  Biggest openers of Ranbir Kapoor:  Sanju – Rs 34.75 crore Besharam – Rs 21.56 crore Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani – Rs 19.45 crore Ae Dil Hai Mushkil – 13.30 crore Tamasha – Rs 10.94 crore Shamshera – Rs 10.25 crore  The 3D and IMAX 3D versions have received humongous response and since the tickets are selling like hotcakes, we definitely expect Brahmastra to roar at the box office. A few days back, exhibitor and trade expert Akshaye Rathi had predicted the opening day collections of above Rs 20 crore and said,  “I think going purely by the kind of advance bookings that we are witnessing and the euphoria that we’re seeing around the release of Brahmastra and especially in its 3D version. I think the day 1 of it should be nothing less than 20 crores and if the reports of the movie are solid, it can go upwards to 25 or maybe more. So, very, very excited about the kind of draw in the kind of anticipation it seemed from the audience, especially families, and family where they are kids involved. So there’s huge anticipation around it, and I’m pretty hopeful that despite so to say handicapped in Maharashtra, where there is Ganesh visarjan and therefore a lot of evening shows are kind of they don’t function as smoothly because the crowds that are all over across the streets of Maharashtra. Despite that, we look at those kind of numbers. If the reports are nice, the extended weekend can absolutely go ballistic.

      "body": "New York: Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur became the first African woman in history to reach the semi-finals of the US Open on Tuesday as France’s Caroline Garcia ended the hopes of American teenager Coco Gauff to advance to the last four.  Jabeur, who also claimed a notable first in July as the first woman from Africa to reach the final at Wimbledon, scored a 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) win over Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic.  The 28-year-old will now face Garcia in the semi-finals after the in-form 17th seed dispatched the 18-year-old Gauff 6-3, 6-4 in Tuesday’s other quarter-final.  Tomljanovic had landed in the quarter-finals after a run which included a third round victory over Serena Williams, in what was most likely the 23-time Grand Slam champion’s final singles match before retirement.  But the Croatia-born Aussie’s battling campaign came to a grinding halt against the dynamic fifth-seeded Jabeur, the Tunisian attacking from the outset and never letting up.  Jabeur said she had been infused with belief since reaching the Wimbledon final, where she was beaten in three sets by Kazakhstans’s Elena Rybakina.  “I believe more in myself,” Jabeur said. “After Wimbledon it was very positive. Even though I lost the final, I knew I had it in me to win a Grand Slam. And here I am in the semi-finals of the US Open.”  Jabeur is known affectionately as the “Minister of Happiness” by fans in Tunisia for the joy that her progress on court has brought to her homeland.   However Jabeur admitted she had let her frustration get the better of her on Tuesday, when she banged her racquet in frustration several times after coughing up multiple service breaks in the second set.  “I think I’m gonna be fired from my job as Minister of Happiness,” she joked.  “It is tough to manage my frustration. I apologise for my behavior. I really wanted to keep calm but the racquet kept slipping away from my hand.”  Sweet Caroline  Tomljanovic admitted she had been outfoxed by an opponent she described as “crafty.”  “When she’s playing well, it’s very hard to find where to go,” Tomljanovic said. “Just really impressed with her game.”  US Open 2022 Ons Jabeur creates history in semifinal foray joined by Carolina Garcia into lastfour Caroline Garcia came into the US Open on the back of a title in Cincinnati. AP  Jabeur will head into her semi-final against Garcia aiming to extend an unbeaten record against the Frenchwoman after wins at the 2019 US Open and 2020 Australian Open.  Garcia reached the first Grand Slam semi-final of her career after an ultimately emphatic win over American hope Gauff.  “My head is buzzing, I can’t describe how I feel,” Garcia said after a quarter-final she dominated almost from start to finish.  Garcia arrived in New York fresh from winning the Cincinnati Masters, and Tuesday’s win was her 13th straight singles victory.   The 28-year-old said she was flourishing after regaining full fitness. She took a two-month break from tennis leading up to the French Open in June to recover from an ankle problem.  “I always played very aggressive and the last couple of months I feel healthy again and I’ve been able to move and practice the way I want,” said Garcia.  “I just go for my shots even when I’m stressed or when I don’t feel it. The way to improve for me is to move forward and I just try to follow that way.”  Gauff meanwhile took satisfaction from her first US Open quarter-final appearance but admitted her campaign was tinged by disappointment.  “First quarter-final at the US Open, so there’s a lot to be proud of. But definitely disappointed,” she said.  “I think it makes me want to work even harder. I feel like I know what I have to do.”  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

      "body": "London: Defending champion Billy Horschel on Tuesday hit out at “hypocritical” LIV Golf rebels who are preparing to play in this week’s BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.  DP World Tour members including Ian Poulter, Sergio Garcia and Lee Westwood are eligible for the event near London after their suspensions for playing in the inaugural event of the Saudi-backed breakaway series were temporarily stayed on appeal.  American Talor Gooch and Mexico’s Abraham Ancer are in the field by virtue of being in the world’s top 60, but Horschel believes they are being “hypocritical” in chasing ranking points, having never shown any interest in the event before.  “Even though Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter have been stalwarts for the European Tour (now known as the DP World Tour), I don’t think those guys really should be here,” said the US golfer.  “I honestly don’t think that the American guys who haven’t supported the Tour should be here. Abraham Ancer, Talor Gooch… you’ve never played this tournament, you’ve never supported the DP World Tour. Why are you here?  “You are here for one reason only and that’s to try to get world ranking points because you don’t have it (on LIV Golf).  “It’s hypocritical because of what some of these guys have said when they said they wanted to play less golf. It’s pretty hypocritical to come over here and play outside LIV when your big thing was to spend more time with family and want to play less golf.  “I wouldn’t call Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter hypocrites because they never said they wanted to play less. The guys that have publicly stated they want to play less, those are the hypocrites.”  Ryder Cup  World number six Jon Rahm also expressed his dissatisfaction with the situation as tensions grow between LIV Golf defectors and those remaining loyal to the established tours.  “There are many players that have been key for European Tour golf and the Ryder Cup that have a lot of collective years on the European Tour,” said the Spaniard. “Them coming, I don’t necessarily think it’s a bad thing.  “What I don’t understand is some players that have never shown any interest in the European Tour, have never shown any interest in playing this event, being given an opportunity just because they can get world ranking points and hopefully make majors next year.”  But Rahm is optimistic a solution can be found to the Ryder Cup selection dilemma facing European captain Luke Donald, with qualifying for next year’s contest in Rome getting under way in Wentworth from Thursday.  Ryder Cup stalwarts Westwood, Poulter and Garcia are currently eligible to qualify for the team pending the outcome of a hearing in February.  “There’s only one problem in life that doesn’t have a solution, and that’s death. That’s it. Everything else has a solution,” said Rahm.  “If the European Tour really want them to play and as a team we want them to play, I think a solution can be reached. If every party is not happy about it, I don’t know.”  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot and Bhavnagar will play hosts to the National Games being held after a gap of seven years since 2015, while the track cycling event will be held in New Delhi.  “To ensure the esteemed significance of the National Games, participation of all eligible eminent athletes who have taken part/won medals in the International Games and Championships are necessary to compete in the 36th National Games,” the IOA said in a letter to all the NSFs and state Olympic associations.  “The Sports Federations and State Olympic Associations are requested to keep this in mind when selecting the athletes for representing their sports and States,” IOS Secretary General Rajeev Mehta said in the letter.  Mehta said wholehearted support and cooperation from the IOA, NSFs and State Olympic Associations will play a vital role in making the National Games successful.  “As far as the athletes are concerned, participation in the National Games is most important for them.”  Mehta said the NSFs will tell the IOA who among the top athletes of the country are available for the National Games.  “I have asked the NSFs and they will reply who among the top athletes are available or not. We will see after that.”  An estimated 7,000 athletes from 28 states and eight Union Territories are expected to take part across 36 disciplines that include most traditional Olympic sports.  Indigenous sports like mallakhamb and yogasana will also feature in the National Games for the first time.

The IOC also decided to postpone its session earlier scheduled to be held in Mumbai in May next year.  “In view of the uncertain situation, the IOC Session that is due to take place in Mumbai in May 2023 is postponed until September/October 2023,” the letter said.  “Depending on the decisions that will be taken during the IOC Executive Board meeting in December 2022 relating to the NOC of India, the IOC Executive Board will decide as to whether the IOC Session in 2023 should be maintained in India or be relocated.”  The IOC said in order to agree on a constructive solution and establish a roadmap leading to the elections of IOA, it will organise a joint meeting with all parties concerned later this month in Lausanne.  “In view of the above, we propose to organise a joint meeting on 27 September 2022 in Lausanne and my colleague Jrme Poivey, Associate Director, NOC Relations Department, will revert to you and all concerned parties accordingly for the details of this meeting,” McLeod said.  The IOC had also earlier threatened to suspend the IOA if it failed to conduct its election at the earliest.  The IOA elections were due in December last year but could not be held due to amendments in the poll process.  Last December, the IOA had formed a six-member committee to look into the amendments to be made to its constitution before holding elections so as to align it with the National Sports Code.  In May this year, Batra was removed as IOA chief after the Delhi High Court struck down the post of ‘life member’ in Hockey India, through which he had contested and won the apex body elections in 2017.  Batra later officially resigned as IOA President. After he was removed by the High Court, Batra had issued a statement, announcing his decision not to contest the IOA elections.

      "body": "Manchester: Manchester United led English football’s tributes to Queen Elizabeth II before their 1-0 defeat against Real Sociedad in the Europa League, while Roma boss Jose Mourinho was in mourning after the monarch’s death on Thursday.  United, West Ham and Arsenal players — the Premier League teams in action in Europe’s second and third tier tournaments — all wore black armbands after the Queen died aged 96 earlier in the day.  There were sombre atmospheres at Old Trafford and the London Stadium, with United and West Ham both holding a minute’s silence prior to kick-off.  West Ham fans sang ‘God save the Queen’ during their 3-1 win against Romanian side FCSB in the Europa Conference League.  The death of the nation’s longest-reigning monarch was announced after Arsenal had already kicked off at FC Zurich, so the Gunners had a minute’s silence before the start of the second half of their 2-1 Europa League win.  Former United, Chelsea and Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho paid a sombre tribute to the Queen after Roma’s 2-1 Europa League loss at Bulgarian side Ludogorets.  “I’m so sorry. I have lived in England for many years, my family is there,” Mourinho told Sky Sport Italy.  “I don’t think there’s anyone who doesn’t appreciate this great woman, I’m sorry.”   During an immaculately observed minute’s silence in Manchester, United’s players linked arms while Sociedad did the same on the other side of the centre-circle.  Several United fans were seen crying in the stands, while Sociedad’s fans held their blue and white scarves aloft in tribute during the minute’s silence.  There had been no pre-match music and the digital advertising hoardings were switched off, while flags at Old Trafford were at half-mast as a sign of the club’s “utmost respect” for the Queen.  “Manchester United shares the sorrow of the entire nation following the announcement from Buckingham Palace on the passing of Her Majesty, the Queen,” a club statement said.  “The club recognises her immense contribution to public life, including sport, both here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth, and around the world.”  ‘Truly saddened’  UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin added: “UEFA and European football are truly saddened by the passing away of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, one of the world’s most-respected figures.  “Our thoughts are with her family and the President of the English Football Association Prince William, as well as with the citizens of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms.”  The usual chants in support of United and against the club’s owners the Glazer family were heard once the game started, but the atmosphere felt more subdued than usual.   Erik Ten Hag described Brazil forward Antony as United’s “missing link” after the Brazil forward scored on his debut against Arsenal on Sunday following his £82 million move from Ajax.  But the 22-year-old struggled to make any impact during a disjointed United performance.  Cristiano Ronaldo was making only his second United start this season, while Brazil midfielder Casemiro was given his first start since arriving from Real Madrid.  Neither player could spark United, who saw a 35th minute header from Ronaldo correctly disallowed for offside.  Sociedad clinched their victory in the 59th minute when United defender Lisandro Martinez was controversially penalised for handball.  The ball only hit Martinez’s arm after bouncing off his knee but following a VAR check the decision was confirmed and Brais Mendez stroked the spot-kick past David De Gea.  After winning four successive Premier League games, United were beaten for the third time in boss ten Hag’s reign.   Brazilian teenager Marquinhos scored on his Arsenal debut as the Premier League leaders recovered from their first defeat of the season at United last weekend.  Marquinhos, signed from Sao Paulo in June, finished first-time from a low Eddie Nketiah cross in the 16th minute to put Arsenal ahead.  Zurich equalised just before half-time when Mirlind Kryeziu converted a penalty after a foul in the box by Nketiah.  Nketiah made amends by scoring the winning goal just after the hour mark, heading in from Marquinhos’s cross.  Elsewhere in the Europa League, PSV Eindhoven and Bodo/Glimt drew 1-1, with Cody Gakpo after Albert Gronbaek had given the Norwegian champions the lead.  Lazio beat Feyenoord 4-2 thanks to Matias Vecino’s double.  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Brazilian football great Pele was among other sports stars who paid tribute.   “I have been a great admirer of Queen Elizabeth II since the first time I saw her in person, in 1968, when she came to Brazil to witness our love for football and experienced the magic of a packed Maracana,” he tweeted.  “Her deeds have marked generations. This legacy will last forever.”   England football captain Harry Kane was another to mourn the queen’s death on Thursday, writing on Twitter: “The queen was an amazing inspiration and will be remembered for her incredible years of service to this country. Rest in peace, Your Majesty.”  The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said Friday’s play between England and South Africa in the third Test at the Oval in London would not take place.  Thursday’s first day in London was washed out without a ball bowled. The three-match series is locked at 1-1.  Play at the PGA Championship at Wentworth, near London, was suspended on Thursday evening when news broke of the death of the monarch and it was later confirmed that there would be no play on Friday.  Cycling’s Tour of Britain, which was set to finish on the Isle of Wight on Sunday, was called off entirely after Thursday’s fifth stage.  Manchester United’s 1-0 home defeat in the Europa League against Real Sociedad went ahead on Thursday but a minute’s silence was held before kick-off and players wore black armbands.  The English Football League announced the postponement of Friday’s two scheduled matches, adding “a determination regarding the remainder of this weekend’s scheduled fixtures will be made following a review of the official mourning guidance”.  Racing in mourning  It was reported that a meeting of governing bodies across a range of sports has been scheduled for Friday morning, where officials will set out government guidance on the official 10-day period of mourning.  It is understood sports chiefs will be left to make their own judgements regarding the staging of events.  The British Horseracing Authority said the sport was in mourning for the queen, who showed an intense passion for racing throughout her life.  “Her Majesty has been one of the greatest and most influential supporters in the history of horse racing,” the BHA said.  “Her passion for racing and the race horse shone brightly throughout her life”.  The BHA’s statement added: “It is right, therefore, that all racing is suspended for today and tomorrow as we begin to grieve Her Majesty’s passing and remember her extraordinary life and contribution to our sport and our nation.”  ‘Grievously missed’   Former England captain and current World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont tweeted: “Her Majesty The Queen will be remembered as a much-loved, visionary monarch, who cared deeply about all people under her reign, and was an avid supporter of sport and its power to unite communities.”   World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said the queen had shown “exceptional leadership, grace, wisdom and fortitude”.  “I will never forget her total commitment to the success of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games,” Coe said.  “She has been a source of continuity and comfort, and she will be grievously missed by us all.”  The United States Tennis Association staged “a moment of silence at the US Open in New York just before the women’s semi-finals got underway.   A message on Twitter from Wimbledon, where the queen previously served as a patron, read: “We wish to convey our deepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences to The Royal Family on the sad passing of Her Majesty The Queen.”     North America’s National Hockey League (NHL) posted footage from the Queen’s ceremonial puck drop at a 2002 contest between the Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks.   Tyson Fury, Britain’s heavyweight world boxing champion, posted a picture of the queen on Twitter along with the words: “Thoughts & prayers with my Queen tonight, may God be with you.”  In Australia, a British colony for more than 100 years, the National Rugby League and Australian Football League were set to hold a minute’s silence prior to weekend fixtures.

      "body": "Zurich: Mondo Duplantis, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Noah Lyles showed off all their pedigree by setting meet records en route to victories at the Diamond League final in Zurich on Thursday.  Duplantis, after a rare defeat in Brussels last week, gave a masterclass in pole vaulting at a 25,000 sell-out Letzigrund Stadium, the Swede eventually winning with 6.07 metres.   “To end like this and be able to walk away with a win – my second Diamond League trophy and another meeting record – it is the perfect cherry on top,” the US-born Swedish vaulter said.   Fraser-Pryce stormed back to “remarkable” winning ways in the 100m having also suffered a rare blip in the Belgian capital.  The 35-year-old Jamaican clocked a meet record-equalising 10.65 seconds, just 0.03sec off her personal best and the seventh time this season she has gone under 10.70.  “This was remarkable, and I am very proud that I came away with a 10.65 – I started with a 10.6 and I finish with a 10.6 so there is nothing more I could ask for,” she said.   Lyles smashed Jamaican legend Usain Bolt’s 10-year-old 200m meet record by 0.14sec as he scorched through for victory in 19.52sec.  “Breaking the meet records and beating the fastests in the world, that’s what it’s all about. It just takes another year to run even faster,” said the two-time world 200m champion.  That top trio of athletes was part of 19 reigning Olympic champions, 21 world champions and 20 European champions in individual events on show for the final, a true feast of the highest-quality track and field.  Athletes were competing to bag a Diamond Trophy and prize money of $30,000, while in addition there were wildcard entries up for grabs for next year’s World Athletics Championships in Budapest.  World 200m champion Shericka Jackson made sure of a Jamaican one-two in the women’s sprint events as she blasted to a 21.80sec victory in her preferred distance after coming second behind Fraser-Pryce in the blue riband event.  Ingebrigtsen on fire   In the absence of 400m hurdling compatriot Karsten Warholm, Jakob Ingebrigtsen was left flying Norway’s flag and duly made no mistake in the men’s 1500m, outsprinting the field to deprive Kenya’s Timothy Cheruiyot of a sixth consecutive Diamond League Final win.  Ingebrigtsen, the world 5,000m champion and Olympic and European 1,500m gold medallist, looked in electric form as he strode through the line in a world-leading 3:29.02.  “I am happy with tonight and also with the season overall. There are always things you can improve. You can always get better and I will try to do that,” the Norwegian said.  The men’s 400m hurdles were won by Brazil’s Mr. Consistency, Alison Dos Santos, in 46.98sec, leaving him unbeaten this season in the event in which he was also crowned world champion in Oregon.  Femke Bol of the Netherlands, a three-time European gold medallist in Munich, easily won the women’s one-lap hurdles.  There was a treble Kenyan middle-distance triumph as Faith Kipyegon won the women’s 1,500m and Mary Moraa claimed the 800m title.  That was followed by world champion Emmanuel Korir producing a stunning burst to win the men’s 800m in 1:43.26.  Nigeria’s Tobi Amusan lived up to her billing as 100m hurdles world champion and world record holder by storming to a meet record of 12.29sec, smashing Gail Devers’ 22-year-old mark.  Venezuela’s Yulimar Rojas was again a class apart in the triple jump, winning in 15.28m to retain her Diamond title, while Cuban Andy Diaz Hernandez snatched victory in the men’s jump-off from Portugal’s world and Olympic champion Pedro Pichardo.  Grenada’s three-time Olympic medallist Kirani James, in 44.26sec, and Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic, in a personal best of 48.99sec, won the 400m titles respectively.  The men’s 100m was taken by American Trayvon Bromell in 9.94sec, the sole sprinter to go sub-10sec, while teammate Grant Holloway raced to a 13.02sec victory in the 110m hurdles.   And Ukraine’s Yaroslava Mahuchikh capped off a season in which she won the world indoor title in Belgrade back in March by triumphing in the high jump with a best of 2.03m.  “Every competition, every win, is so important for me and for Ukraine,” said Mahuchikh, who endured a three-day trip by car to Serbia after fleeing her country when Russia invaded on February 24.

The death of the 96-year-old sovereign, the longest-serving monarch in British history, was announced while Thursday’s first round of the European Tour’s flagship event was still in progress at the Wentworth course, southwest of London.  “Out of respect for Her Majesty and the Royal Family, play has been suspended at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth Club for the remainder of Thursday and flags at Wentworth Club will be lowered to half-mast,” said a European tour statement.  “Furthermore, no play will take place at the BMW PGA Championship on Friday and the golf course and practice facilities will be closed.  “Further updates on the resumption of play will be provided in due course.”  England’s Andy Sullivan and Tommy Fleetwood, together with Norway’s Viktor Hovland, were the joint clubhouse leaders at eight under par, after the trio all shot rounds of 64, when play was suspended.  The tournament had been taking place against the backdrop of the bitter civil war in golf sparked by the creation of the ‘rebel’ LIV Tour.  Several players from the Saudi-backed LIV series are competing at Wentworth this week, a decision four-time major champion Rory McIlroy, who has remained loyal to the established European and US PGA tours, said he found “hard to stomach”.

      "body": "Zurich: Pole vault king Mondo Duplantis has vowed to “crank it up another notch” next season after an “amazing” year that saw him win two world titles and continue to improve his own world record.  On the back of winning Olympic gold at last year’s Tokyo Games, the US-born Swede has gone on to totally dominate his event this year, winning the world indoor title in Belgrade in March and world outdoor gold in Oregon in July.  Both titles were claimed in world record heights of 6.20 and 6.21 metres respectively. In a dream summer, Duplantis also sealed European gold in Munich.  His one glitch came last week in Brussels when he failed three times at 5.91m to break a 17-strong season win streak and hand Filipino Ernest John Obiena a shock victory.  Duplantis, 22, reacted as a winner might. He took it squarely on the chin, saying the rare defeat was the wake-up call he needed to keep him at the top of his game.  The reaction required duly came in front of 25,000 raucous spectators at Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium in Thursday’s final of the Diamond League.  Read: Duplantis, Fraser-Pryce and Lyles shine in Zurich Diamond League final  He cleared 6.07 metres, improving his own meet record, his rivals long out of the reckoning.  “To end like this and be able to walk away with a win — my second Diamond League trophy and another meeting record — it is the perfect cherry on top,” the US-born vaulter said.  “This is everything. If I come into this competition and I don’t perform well, the whole season, which was so amazing, it doesn’t feel as good as it should feel.”  Duplantis acknowledged that he’d enjoyed an “awesome season” during which he has vaulted higher than 6m a staggering 15 times.  “I had a lot of great competitions, but I think being able to jump 6 metres so many times, it shows this is the kind of jumper that I am right now,” he said.  “In any competition, on any given day, I should think I should be able to jump 6 metres.”   In a worrying statement for his rival vaulters, Duplantis said steps would be taken to improve even more next season, which will feature the world championships in Budapest in August.  “I have the same goals next year. We are going to try and crank it up another notch,” he said.  “I always want to be improving, so this fall I am going to try that.”  But he admitted that there would be some downtime.  “It is hard to think about next season right now,” he said. “I am living the moment right now. I am really enjoying this trophy.  “I am going to have a good time, and I am going to celebrate this whole year because it was an amazing one.”  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

      "body": "Former United States President Barack Obama is quite the all-arounder. He has vowed the world with his oratory skills and continues bagging awards for it.  The latest feather in his cap is an Emmy award for lending his voice to the Netflix documentary series called Our Great National Parks. With this, Obama is officially halfway from getting an EGOT status, having previously won two Grammy awards.  Let’s take a look at what EGOT is and what it takes to achieve the status.  What is EGOT?  EGOT is an acronym for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony – the four most prestigious awards in the world of television, recording, film and theatre, respectively.  According to a report by Insider, achieving the grand combination of all four is the actual measurement of being an “all-rounder” performer. It’s also referred to as the “grand slam” of American entertainment.  For years, the EGOT status has been hailed as the most reputable honour in Hollywood.  What’s the story behind EGOT?  Actor Philip Michael Thomas, who is known for his performance in the 80s show Miami Vice, is credited with making EGOT the dream that many artists wish to achieve some day.  In an interview with The Associated Press, Thomas discussed about his future plans for success which he summarised in four letters: EGOT. He said, “That stands for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. Hopefully, in the next five years, I will win all those awards.”  It is said that the actor’s belief in EGOT was so strong that he had the letters engraved on a gold pendant, which he wore around his neck. Interestingly, he has never been nominated for any of the awards.  The term gained popularity when it featured in a show called 30 Rock, where an actor makes it his goal to achieve the status, reports The Atlantic.  What makes Obama half an EGOT?  The former president bagged the Emmy for best narrator Emmy for his work on the series Our Great National Parks. The five-part show that features national parks from across the world is produced by Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company called Higher Ground.  He was nominated for the creative arts Emmys against former basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, renowned historian and broadcaster David Attenborough and actor Lupita Nyong’o.  In the past, Obama has been nominated for three Grammys out of which he has won two.  Obama has won two Grammys for narrating his memoirs. In 2006 he was awarded a Grammy for his audiobook called Dreams From My Father. Then again in 2008, he won the award for anotheraudiobook called The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream.  He lost the third Grammy nomination to actor Don Cheadle.  He is yet to win an Oscar. In 2020, the documentary American Factory, which was produced by Michelle and Barack’s production house, won the Academy. But since neither of them personally received the honour, it wasn’t counted as an individual achievement.  Who is part of the EGOT club?  Until now 17 people have had the honour of being an EGOT.  Some popular names who have obtained the most-respected status are actors Mel Brooks, Whoopi Goldberg, Audrey Hepburn, filmmaker Mike Nichols, songwriter Robert Lopez and singer-songwriter John Legend.  The most recent artist to join the club is actor Jennifer Hudson.  Other famous personalities who are just a Tony Award away from EGOT are director Martin Scorsese, actor Kate Winslet, singer and former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr.  British singer Adele is 3/4th of an EGOT as she won an Emmy this year for a special telecast of her concert “One Night Show”. She has won an Oscar and Grammy before. The same goes for rapper Eminem. Both of them bagged a couple of Emmys on Saturday.  Singer Elton John and actors Viola Davis, Helen Mirren, and Al Pacino, all need a Grammy to achieve the status.

      "body": "The demise of business tycoon Cyrus Mistry on Sunday in a road accident near Palghar in Maharashtra on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway has once again thrown up questions about the construction of the road and its chequered past.  Mistry, the former chairman of Tata Sons and the scion of the real estate behemoth Shapoorji Pallonji Group, was travelling with three other family friends — noted gynaecologist Dr Anahita Pandole, her husband Darius Pandole and Jehangir Pandole, the brother of Darius — from Gujarat’s Udvada, a Parsi pilgrim town.  Dr Anahita Pandole was reportedly driving the Mercedes when it crashed into a divider on a bridge on the Surya river at Charoti Naka in Palghar, 120 km away from Mumbai. The car was speeding and tried to overtake another vehicle from the wrong side (the left), a police officer told PTI.  Mistry and Jehangir Pandole who were in the back seat, who weren’t wearing seat belts, died on the spot, whereas Dr Anahita Pandole and her husband Darius were admitted to Rainbow Hospital in Vapi with serious injuries. The two were later shifted to Mumbai.  News reports have confirmed that the last rites of Cyrus Mistry will be performed in Mumbai on Tuesday at Mumbai’s Worli crematorium.  As the country still reels from the shock of Cyrus Mistry’s demise, we take a closer look at the highway and why it’s considered a ‘black spot’.  A killer road  According to All India Vahan Chalak Malak Mahasangha, faulty engineering of the Mumba-Ahmedabad highway led to the fatal crash involving Cyrus Mistry.  Harbans Singh Nanade, spokesperson of the All India Vahan Chalak Malak Mahasangha, was quoted as telling mid-day, “The width of the southbound lane on Charoti flyover is 10.50 metres, has been narrowed down to seven-metre on the bridge which is built over Surya River. What kind of road engineering is this? The lane is also serpentine and the person behind the wheel cannot see the L-shaped death trap which gynaecologist (Dr Anahita Pandole) dashed into.”  “Motorists coming from Gujarat often prefer taking the right arm of the bridge as the left arm is very confusing. A new driver often misjudges the black spot and hits the L-shaped death trap. Its length is not visible to the driver. The highway authority has not put any warning signs,” Nanade was quoted as saying.  Auto journalist Bob Rupani echoed similar sentiments, saying to India Today that the Ahmedabad-Mumbai highway is one of the most crowded and badly designed highways in the country.  “The approach to the bridges on this highway need huge improvement. This highway that goes through Palghar is also used by lots of heavy trucks moving goods between Delhi and Mumbai and the truckers insist on occupying the right lane and force you to overtake dangerously from the left,” he told India Today.  Another issue with the highway is that the three-lane Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway that narrows to two lanes (where the accident took place) lacks a signboard warning motorists of the dangers ahead.  Motorists frequently driving on the highway also speak of the perils of using this road. Most complain that many parts of the highway are pockmarked and traffic discipline is very low.  Transport activist Jagdeep Desai, who often travels on the road, was quoted as telling Times of India, “Many vehicles can be seen overtaking from the left. Also, the road is uneven in some patches.”  Jainam Mehta, another road user, said on Twitter, “The entire stretch of Mumbai-Ahmedabad National Highway is in a poor condition. The major part of the road is covered in potholes. This NH 48 route is one of India’s most used/commuted highways and yet it’s in such a vulnerable state. Pathetic infrastructure. RIP #CyrusMistry.”  What the numbers say  As per data published by the National Crime Records Bureau, as many as 1.73 lakh people have lost their lives in around 4.22 lakh traffic accidents in the country in 2021 with Uttar Pradesh reporting the highest number of deaths in such mishaps at 24,711 deaths, followed by Tamil Nadu which recorded 16,685 deaths.  The report stated that the number of traffic accidents in the country increased from 3,68,828 in 2020 to 4,22,659 in 2021.  A Free Press Journal report added that in the past two years, 100 people have died and nearly 50 have sustained injuries between Manor (Palghar) and Achad (Gujarat) on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway. This 52-km stretch has nearly a dozen accident spots, including the bridge over Surya river.  Globally, India accounts for 11 per cent of road traffic fatalities with just two per cent of vehicle share.  This clearly shows that India still struggles with road safety issues such as check on over-speeding, wearing of seat belts for rear passengers and inconsistent road designs.  Police speak  Traffic police officials have, however, stated that the road design wasn’t responsible for the accident in which Cyrus Mistry lost his life and added that it was over speeding, which caused the crash.  Officials have stated that the site is not accident-prone and also does not feature in the list of “black spots” where fatal accidents have taken place before.  “We checked the earlier accidents records but none had taken place on the spot where this one happened. It looks like the car was speeding and there was an error in the judgement of the driver while taking the bridge. Since the road narrowed to two lanes from three, the driver could not shift from left to right and lost control of the wheel and rammed into the divider,” said a police officer.

Accusing the party of “unplanned administration” in the state, Bommai alleged that the previous Congress dispensations approved construction activities “right-left-centre” in the lake areas, on the tank bunds and buffer zones.He said they did not think of maintaining the lakes.  The Karnataka chief minister added that his government has taken up a “challenge” to improve things now and had allocated Rs 1,500 crore for development of stormwater drains, PTI reported.  Congress slams BJP government  Hitting out at the saffron party government, senior Karnataka Congress leader and former chief minister Siddaramaiah said that lakes and stormwater drainage in the city have been encroached upon. While his government had initiated a drive to clear stormwater drainage encroachment, the BJP government has failed to work in the last three-and-half years, The Times of India quoted Siddaramaiah as claiming.",

      "body": "Influencers take note – the Centre is expected to issue guidelines making it mandatory for social media stars to disclose their association with products they promote.  The guidelines are expected to be issued within the next two weeks.  “The Department of Consumer Affairs is coming out with guidelines on social media influencers. It is creating dos and don’ts for them,” a government l source told PTI.  Let’s take a look at why this is happening and what social media influencers will need to take note of:  How do influencers make money?  Influencers who are popular on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram make money by recommending products to their followers.  As per Hindu Business Line, brands either pay influencers or give them free products.  Paid social media promotion works similarly to word-of-mouth marketing, but on a far bigger scale due to the sheer power and reach of social media, as per News9.  Influencing in India is big business.  Digital agency Adlift has pegged the influencer marketing segment in India at between $75 million and $150 million every year, as per the report.  Why now?  This comes as brands more and more are turning social media influencers for paid promotion and reviews, as per Hindu Business Line.  How many likes Centres plan to rein in social media influencers explained Representational image. News18  As per Deccan Chronicle, some of India’s most savvy early internet users gained huge followings by posting reviews of products on the platform, but most don’t disclose their links to companies.  The Centre’s plan is to put an end to fake or paid reviews from products ranging from cars to smartphones on social media and e-commerce sites, as per the report.  Rohit Kumar Singh, the most senior bureaucrat at the consumer affairs department, told reporters in New Delhi on Wednesday the Centre will announce a framework of regulations targeting people paid to endorse merchandise.  Such persons will be held liable in case of issues related to the product, he added.  Sources told News18 the decision is aimed at protecting the consumer from any kind of false claims.  “Anyone who is a social media influencer and pushing any particular brand will now have to come clean,” sources added.  Influencers will need to put disclaimers in such endorsement posts, sources told PTI.  Sources told Hindu Business Line failure to comply could leave influencers facing heavy penalties and that such a move could leave brands re-examining their influencer marketing strategies.  The Central Consumer Protection Authority can levy penalties of up to ₹10 lakh on endorsers for “misleading ads” in the first instance, and these can go up to ₹50 lakh in the case of further instances. It can also prohibit them from endorsing any products for up to three years.  The US Federal Trade Commission has already enforced guidelines for social media influencers, as per Hindu Business Line.  Ambika Sharma, founder and MD, Pulp Strategy, told the outlet the guidelines will lead to more responsible behaviour in the digital marketing ecosystem in the long term, but that it could make influencers more cautious in the short-term.  Payal Sakhuja, founder, Ripple Links, an influencer marketing agency that works with leading brands, added, “The influencer marketing segment now attracts big spends from brands. The government’s guidelines will help regularise this fast-growing and unorganised ecosystem. Brands are increasingly doing paid collaborations with creators across all social media platforms. While many large creators already make disclosures about paid partnerships in their posts, these guidelines will ensure disclosures are uniformly made by all creators.”  Framework to tackle fake reviews to be released shortly  Meanwhile, the department has completed the process of developing a framework to curb fake reviews posted on e-commerce websites. The same will be released shortly.  In May, the department along with the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) held a virtual meeting with stakeholders, including e-commerce entities, to discuss the magnitude of fake reviews on their platforms.  Fake reviews mislead consumers into buying online products and services.  The department had then decided it would develop these frameworks after studying the present mechanism being followed by e-commerce entities in India and best practices available globally.  Since e-commerce involves a virtual shopping experience without any opportunity to physically view or examine the product, consumers heavily rely on reviews posted on platforms to see the opinion and experience of users who have already purchased the good or service.  “Traceability by ensuring the authenticity of the reviewer and the associated liability of the platform are the two key issues here. Also e-commerce players must disclose as to how they choose the ‘most relevant reviews’ for display in a fair and transparent manner,” Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh had said  In July, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) called upon the government to bring brand endorsers, social media influencers and bloggers under the proposed framework to protect online consumers from fake reviews of products and services.  CAIT also argued that rating of a product or service should be made a part of the policy framework for reviews.  Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh in May held a virtual meeting with stakeholders to discuss the impact of fake and misleading reviews on online consumers and preparation of a roadmap to prevent such a situation.  The traders’ body urged the government for an early roll out of a well-defined and robust policy to protect consumers from fake and deceptive reviews for products.  It said such reviews influence the choice of consumers to a great extent thereby constitute an act to cheat the consumers for depriving them from getting right value for their spendings.  “In this context, the brand endorsers, social media influencers, bloggers on goods and services should be brought under the ambit of policy on fake and deceptive reviews,” CAIT stated.  CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal opined that in the current scenario, the trend of purchasing from e-commerce sites is increasing day by day and in the absence of having a physical touch and feel experience, reviews and ratings of goods and services assume significance in impacting the choice of consumers.

      "body": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate Delhi’s revamped Central Vista Avenue, the three-kilometre avenue along the Rajpath which runs from Vijay Chowk to India Gate.   The redevelopment project of the Central Vista — the nation’s power corridor — envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping the three-km Rajpath, a new prime minister’s residence and office, and a new vice-president’s enclave.  The iconic boulevard that is being remade has existed since the early decades of the 20th Century.  One of Delhi’s most popular tourist attractions, it is used for various ceremonial functions and events such as the Republic Day parade.  This is the first project that has been completed under the Modi government’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan.  The Rajpath will now be known as ‘Kartavya Path’ after the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) on Wednesday gave its nod.  Let’s take a closer look at how Central Vista has changed:  According to an official document, there are more than 900 light poles, including those in the gardens and along the Rajpath between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate, a move aimed at making the Central Vista more pedestrian-friendly round the clock.  A newer greener Central Vista Avenue How iconic boulevard has been revamped More than 900 light poles have been installed to make the area pedestrian friendly. ANI  Eight amenity blocks have been built while four pedestrian underpasses have been constructed in the entire stretch that has 422 red granite benches.  Along the Rajpath, new red granite walkways spreading 1,10,457 square metre have been created, replacing bajri sand that lined the ground earlier.  As many as 987 concrete bollards have been installed on the Rajpath.  A total of 1,490 modern-look manholes have replaced the earlier ones.  The 94,600 sqm Bajri pathway area has been redeveloped into a 1,10,457 square metre granite walkway, which can make your visits with family and friends more exciting and memorable, as per News18.  As per WION, photos taken show substantial changes to walkways, micro-irrigation and drainage services, seats, tree avenues, and other features.  The refurbished area appears to be broader, cleaner, greener and equipped with many beneficial modifications.  As per Indian Express, the revamped Central Vista avenue includes a 16.5 kilometre granite walkway that lies parallelly along both sides of Rajpat.  A newer greener Central Vista Avenue How iconic boulevard has been revamped This is the first project that has been completed under the Modi government’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan.

The new trash cans have a clean, contemporary appearance and are hidden under granite, as per the report.  A total of 16 bridges, eight over each of two canals, have been laid out. The canals that lie on either side of Rajpath now have bridges over them connecting the walkways that run alongside.  The stretch has storm water drains to prevent waterlogging of the lawns. It also has well-lit light poles and power cables, and pipelines have been laid in underground trenches.  Central Vista, once operational, has the potential to be a popular tourist attraction, as per News18.  A newer greener Central Vista Avenue How iconic boulevard has been revamped The iconic boulevard that is being remade has existed since the early decades of the 20th Century. ANI  Offices and departments located in the New Delhi district will remain shut after 4 pm, and officials will be asked to work from home on Thursday.  The Kartavya Path also has amenities such as toilet blocks and vending kiosks.  New rules  As per Indian Express, the Central Vista will comprise eight vending plazas where vendors including ice cream sellers can operate. Earlier, ice-cream carts were spread across Rajpath in the evening.  “Ice cream carts will only be allowed in the vending zones. Although we have not taken any decision, we will ensure that these ice cream trolleys are not allowed along roads,” a senior official was quoted as saying by PTI.  Vendors will not be permitted to sell their items on the lawns between C-Hexagon and Man Singh Road, as per Hindustan Times.

From 9 September, the entire stretch will be open for visitors.  Meanwhile, two blocks on each side of India Gate will have eight shops each which will boast of street food from 16 states, selected by Delhi Tourism, as per The Hindu.  The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), an executing agency of the project, has built six new parking spaces to accommodate 1,117 cars and 40 buses on either side of Rajpath.  “Parking will be free for the first 1-2 months. We have asked the New Delhi Municipal Council to manage the parking lots. Initially, parking space for 700 vehicles will be opened to the public due to ongoing construction work at common central secretariat buildings,” an official of the Union housing and urban affairs ministry official told HT.  Two other facilities at C-hexagon have been constructed where 16 shops will be given to artisans or state emporiums to showcase their work.

      "body": "The Bihar government has decided to use seized liquor bottles to make glass bangles.  Despite being a dry state since 5 April, 2016, many hooch tragedies and the deaths of hundreds have been reported in Bihar, leaving the authorities red-faced.  The move by the Nitish Kumar-led Bihar dispensation is being viewed by some as an attempt to woo women voters.  Notably, Kumar had banned the sale and consumption of liquor in 2016, following the Janta Dal United (JDU) leader’s electoral promise to women ahead of Bihar Assembly polls a year earlier.  Even with the ban in place, lakhs of liquor bottles are seized in Bihar every month and crushed with excavators or other heavy machines.  How will the decision be implemented by the Bihar government? Why are Opposition BJP and hospitality industry people skeptical about the move?  Let’s take a closer look:  What’s the plan?  The Bihar government will construct a factory in the capital city Patna under its Rural Livelihoods Promotion programme, known as JEEViKA.  As per Free Press Journal (FPJ), the Nitish government has come into agreement with a bangle manufacturing unit in Uttar Pradesh, which has been tasked with training Bihar women to make glass bangles.  A team of women has already been dispatched to Uttar Pradesh’s Farrukhabad, the chief executive officer of Livelihood Mission told FPJ.  Bole Chudiyan Dry Bihars innovative new plan for old liquor bottles Bihar government will set up a glass bangles-making factory in Patna. ANI (Representational Image)  “Seized illegal liquor bottles during raids were earlier crushed and treated as garbage but now we’ll give these bottles to JEEViKA workers who were trained in making glass bangles. The State Excise and Prohibition department has allocated Rs 1 crore to set up a glass-making factory in Patna and send JEEViKA women for training in bangle-making to other States”, Bihar excise commissioner B Kartikey Dhanji was quoted as saying by The Hindu.  JEEViKA, funded by the World Bank, is a social and economic empowerment programme for the rural poor, which comes under Bihar’s Department of Rural Development.  Dhanji said if the plan succeeds, they will set up more glass bangle-making factories later in other parts of the state.  Moreover, excise officials across Bihar have been asked to take liquor bottles to Patna, the proposed site of the factory, FPJ reported.  Bihar’s liquor tale  After the liquor ban, the illegal liquor trade has flourished in the state with lakhs of bottles being recovered by police officials or the excise department personnel.  As many as 3.7 lakh litres of liquor were seized in more than one lakh raids on those involved in the bootlegged business in August, as per state’s excise department data.  Moreover, 30,000 people were arrested in August alone for disobeying the state’s liquor prohibition law.  Due to overcrowding in jails as a result of its complete prohibition on alcohol, the Bihar government in March passed the Bihar Prohibition and Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2022. The amended law allows those caught consuming liquor to pay a fine before a magistrate to avoid jail time.  Bole Chudiyan Dry Bihars innovative new plan for old liquor bottles Hundreds have died in hooch tragedies in Bihar since 2016. PTI File Photo  If the accused fail to pay the fine, they will be sent to one month’s imprisonment.  However, the relaxed norms are yet to be enforced, ThePrint reported.  BJP opposes move  Bihar BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal has alleged that chief minister Nitish Kumar will allow liquor smuggling to continue for the raw material (alcohol bottles used for making bangles).  “Nitish Kumar and excise department will pass 9 out of 10 liquor consignments and they will seize one consignment to get the raw materials for the bangles factory. This is the real situation of Bihar where agencies are allowing liquor smuggling to take place here,” Jaiswal was quoted as saying by IANS.  More skepticism  President of the Bihar chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Satyajit Singh, told ThePrint that even though the step sounds “innovative”, there are other factors that need consideration.  “There are established glass bangle factories in Faizabad, Mumbai, and Hyderabad. Glass constitutes 75 per cent of glass bangles. [But] there are other materials, such as soda and limestone. Will the government provide the factory with these?” he questioned.  “Will the seizure of illegal liquor bottles be enough to run the factory and [will it] be economically viable? And how will JEEViKA workers compete with established glass bangle makers from outside the state — both financially and quality-wise?” ThePrint quoted him as saying.  A businessman in Patna, Alok Gupta, also raised doubts about the economic feasibility of the glass bangle factories.  He told The Hindu that this is a bid by the Nitish Kumar government to attract women voters.

      "body": "According to Chapter 94 of Bhavishya Puran Uttar Parva, Anant Chaturdashi is celebrated on Chaturdashi Krishna Paksh of Bhadrapad wherein Bhagwan Anant is worshipped.  Yudhishthir asked Krishna about Bhagwan Anant and why this festival is celebrated.  Yudhishthir wondered if Anant is Sheshanag or Brahmor Parmatma.  Krishna replied that he himself is known as Anant born in Vasudev clan, who took the avatar to destroy demons and lessen the burden of the earth, that he was Vishnu, Jishnu, Shiv and Anant and that there is no difference in Sheshanag and him.  Yudhishthir then asked about the importance of this vrat and who performed it first.  The story goes thus — a Vashishth gotra Brahmin named Sumantu was married to sage Bhrigu’s daughter Diksha. They had a daughter named Sheela, who was extremely religious.  When Diksha died of fever, Sumantu took another wife. This woman, Karkasha, was very cruel. When Sheela was of age, Sumantu married her to Kaudinya Muni.  Sumantu asked Karkasha to give some gift to the newlyweds, but Karkasha shut the door in their faces.  The newlyweds slowly walked towards their destination. On the way, Sheela noticed women performing puja on the banks of a river.  She asked about this puja and its importance and showed her readiness to observe this vrat. She was told that it is a day of Janardan worship — where the statue of Janardan is offered flowers, incense, lamps and sweets.  Sheela was told they recite his story and offer a thread of silk or cotton with fourteen knots. They then wear the same thread – women on the left hand and men on right hand – to be exchanged the following year with a new one as per NaradPuran, Chaturth Paad 113.  But the first to be worshipped is Ganesh.  What the scriptures say about Anant Chaturdashi and Ganesh Visarjan Before Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Ganesh Chaturthi was a private affair. Image procured by author  This should be followed for fourteen years. The prayer should be to Bhagwan Anant/Sheshanag.  We should recite the following mantra.  अन्नतसन्सारमहासमुद्रे मगनान समंतभद्र वासुदेव।।  अनंररूपे,विनियोजितात्मा ह्यनन्तरूपाय नमो नमस्ते।।  After tying the thread, one should give half the sweets to Brahmins. The rest should be eaten by yajman and family. The statue should also be donated to Brahmins.  Sheela too observed this vrat. Her life changed immediately. She became rich and lived happily. But then, Kaudinya muni broke the thread of Anant on Sheela’s hand and bad luck returned to Sheela.  Kaudinya muni then set off in search of Anant, praying all the time. He roamed the forest – asking about Anant to a mango tree, to a cow with a calf, then to a bull, then two lakes, then two donkeys and an elephant. Finally, an exhausted Kaudinya muni fell down.  It was then that Bhagwan Anant arrived on the spot as a Brahmin and later gave his Vishwaroop Chaturbhuj darshan.  When Kaudinya muni asked why so many things and elements could not tell him about Bhagwan’s whereabouts, the reply came that they did not see him as they were sinners in their previous birth.  Anant Bhagwan asked Kaudinya muni to observe the Anant Chaturdashi vrat for a happy life.  Now, the question is —  why do so many people in Maharashtra celebrate Visarjanin Anant Chaturdashi?  Nowhere is it mentioned in scriptures that we should carry out Ganesh Visarjan on Anant Chaturdashi but there are many reasons for it – the main being Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak.  What the scriptures say about Anant Chaturdashi and Ganesh Visarjan File image of Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Twitter  Before Tilak, this festival was a private affair.  He made Ganesh Chaturthi a public festival, according to the biography of Tilak by Dhananjay Kheer. It was his organisational ability and leadership which transformed it into a public festival.  Many Hindus were participating in the Muharram rituals that time, but they realised the conspiracy. Tilak then utlised their energy for organising the Ganesh festival and thus people got a substitute.  Ganesh festival societies were founded all over Maharashtra. Pandals were formed for Sarvajanik Ganesh utsav. Youths organised themselves into bands of singers, gymnastic societies were encouraged, and deeds of self-denial and valour were upheld for emulation before the young by fiery speakers and acharyas during Ganesh Chaturthi.  For some time a band of Hindu youths acted as bodyguards of Tilak to protect him against any possible attack by Muslim ruffians. Tilak realised that the British rulers took sides with the Muslims because their policy turned upon selfishness and self-aggrandisement! British sided with Muslims because they saw a danger in the Hindu Sanatan majority who were gradually awakening.  Muslims thought that they were in a minority and backward in education, and they feared that sanatanis were surpassing them in every field. Thanks to Tilak, the first license allowing devotees to play music in the streets during Ganesh immersion — and also during Vijayadashmi and Shiv Jayanti (1916) — was granted by the then police commissioner of Mumbai.  From then people started installing idols in pandals and conducted Visarjan after 10 days which is also Anant Chaturdashi. It is the final auspicious day in Bhadrapad. It is  followed by Shradha and Pitar Paksha, which are inauspicious as per Sanatan Dharma. Hence, visarjan is done on this day — else we’d have to wait till Navratri for an auspicious day.  After 10 days of celebrations, Ganesh Visarjan takes place on this day.  Remember, Ganesh has been invited, so he stays for eleven days and goes back, only to return next year on Ganesh Chaturthi. This is an eternal annual happening. Even in Narad Puran Purva Bhag (Chaturtha Pad) Chapter 113, it is mentioned that we should worship Ganesh first before doing Anant pooja.  Both the festivities are carried out simultaneously with devotion and fanfare. On one side Ganesh Visarjan takes place and on the other Bhagwan Anant is worshipped.

      "body": "Is the coronavirus on its way out?  You might think so. New, updated booster shots are being rolled out to better protect against the variants circulating now. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped COVID-19 quarantine and distancing recommendations. And more people have thrown off their masks and returned to pre-pandemic activities.  But scientists say no. They predict the scourge that’s already lasted longer than the 1918 flu pandemic will linger far into the future.  One reason it’s lasted this long? It’s gotten better and better at getting around immunity from vaccination and past infection. Scientists point to emerging research that suggests the latest omicron variant gaining ground in the US — BA.4.6, which was responsible for around 8 per cent of new US infections last week — appears to be even better at evading the immune system than the dominant BA.5.  Scientists worry the virus may well keep evolving in worrisome ways.  How long will it be around?  White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said COVID-19 will likely be with us for the rest of our lives.  Experts expect COVID-19 will someday become endemic, meaning it occurs regularly in certain areas according to established patterns. But they don’t think that will be very soon.  Still, living with COVID “should not necessarily be a scary or bad concept,” since people are getting better at fighting it, Jha said during a recent question-and-answer session with US Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. “Obviously if we take our foot off the gas — if we stop updating our vaccines, we stop getting new treatments — then we could slip backwards.”  Experts say COVID will keep causing serious illness in some people. The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub made some pandemic projections spanning August 2022 to May 2023, assuming the new tweaked boosters adding protection for the newest omicron relatives would be available and a booster campaign would take place in fall and winter. In the most pessimistic scenario — a new variant and late boosters — they projected 1.3 million hospitalizations and 181,000 deaths during that period. In the most optimistic scenario — no new variant and early boosters — they projected a little more than half the number of hospitalizations and 111,000 deaths.  Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the world is likely to keep seeing repetitive surges until “we do the things we have to do,” such as developing next generation vaccines and rolling them out equitably.  Topol said the virus “just has too many ways to work around our current strategies, and it’ll just keep finding people, finding them again, and self-perpetuating.”  How will the virus mutate?  Scientists expect more genetic changes that affect parts of the spike protein studding the surface of the virus, letting it attach to human cells.  “Every time we think we’ve seen the peak transmission, peak immune escape properties, the virus exceeds that by another significant notch,” Topol said.  But the virus probably won’t keep getting more transmissible forever.  “I think there is a limit,” said Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “What we’re really dealing with, though, is there’s still a lot of people across the world who don’t have any prior immunity — either they haven’t been infected or they haven’t had access to vaccination.”  If humanity’s baseline level of immunity rises significantly, he said, the rate of infections, and with that emergence of more contagious variants, should slow down.  But there is a chance the virus could mutate in a way that causes more severe illness.  “There’s not any inherent reason, biologically, that the virus has to become milder over time,” said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist. The fact it may seem milder now “is likely just the combined effect of all of us having some immune history with the virus.”  While scientists hope that continues, they also point out that immunity gradually wanes.  Will the next variant be another version of Omicron?  Omicron has been around since late last year, with a series of super transmissible versions quickly displacing one another, and Binnicker believes “that will continue at least for the next few months.”  But down the road, he said it’s likely a new variant distinct from omicron will pop up.  The recent wave of infections and re-infections, he said, “gives the virus more chances to spread and mutate and new variants to emerge.”  Can people influence the future of the virus?  Yes, experts said. One way is to get vaccinated and boosted.  “We have a virus out there that’s still circulating, still killing hundreds of Americans every day,” Jha said in a press briefing Tuesday. But, he added: “We now have all of the capability to prevent, I believe, essentially all of those deaths. If people stay up to date on their vaccines, if people get treated if they have a breakthrough infection, we can make deaths from this virus vanishingly rare.”  Not only does vaccination protect against severe disease and death, it raises the level of immunity globally.  CDC director Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday that up to 100,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations and 9,000 deaths could be prevented if Americans get the updated booster at the same rate they typically get an annual flu shot this fall. About half of Americans are typically vaccinated against the flu each year.  People can also keep protecting themselves by taking other precautions like, for example, wearing masks indoors when COVID rates are high.  Longtime nurse Catherine Mirabile said it’s important not to dismiss the dangers of the coronavirus – which sickened her twice, nearly killed her husband and left them both with long COVID. Daily deaths still average around 450 in the US  “People really need to look at this and still take this seriously,” said the 62-year-old from Princeton, West Virginia, who is now on disability. “They could end up in the same shape we’re in.”",

      "body": "San Diego: The big, jovial personality of the Malaysian defence contractor nicknamed “Fat Leonard” got him favours across Asia, where he became rich by wooing US Navy commanders with wild sex parties and luxury gifts.  Leonard Francis has admitted to being the mastermind of one of the most extensive bribery scandals in US military history. Now after staging a bold escape executed in broad daylight over the holiday weekend in an upscale suburban San Diego neighbourhood, many are asking if he employed that same charm to get help to disappear.  Here is a look at the case and what is known and not known.  Who is ‘Fat Leonard’ and why was he convicted?  Francis owned and operated his family’s ship servicing business, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd or GDMA, which supplied food, water and fuel to vessels.  An enigmatic figure, Francis was the main point of contact for US Navy ships at ports across Asia for more than two decades. He was photographed wining and dining with top Navy brass. He plied officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines.  In exchange, officers concealed his company’s overbilling of the US military. After investigators caught on, Francis was lured to San Diego on false pretences and arrested at a hotel in 2013. He pleaded guilty in 2015, admitting that he had offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy officials, defence contractors and others who helped his scheme.  He used his influence to get commanders to steer their ships mostly from the Navy’s Seventh Fleet to ports he controlled so he could cover up fake charges. Prosecutors say he bilked the Navy out of at least $35 million.  Why did he not get sentenced yet?  Francis was facing up to 25 years in prison, but his sentencing hearing date was pushed back repeatedly until the latest date of 22 September because he was a key witness for the US Attorney’s case.  Who is Leonard Francis the big fish in the US Navy bribery case and how did he get away Leonard Francis, also known as “Fat Leonard,” was in home confinement, and allegedly cut off his GPS ankle monitor and left his home on the morning of 4 September. AP  As part of his plea deal, he agreed to cooperate with the investigation stemming back to 2009. With his help, prosecutors secured the convictions of 33 of 34 defendants, including more than two dozen Navy officers.  But while in custody, he was hospitalised and treated for renal cancer and other medical issues, undergoing unspecified procedures, according to court transcripts.  After leaving the hospital, he was allowed by the judge to stay at a condominium in 2018 to continue to receive medical care there but was ordered to wear a GPS monitoring ankle bracelet and have round-the-clock security guards on site.  What is known about his house arrest?  Francis moved from the condominium after having a falling out with the landlord, according to court transcripts. But rather than returning to jail, Francis’ attorneys were able to convince the judge to allow him to continue to remain on medical furlough.  He moved to another rental property. He would remain under house arrest for nearly five years. But US District Court Judge Janis Sammartino expressed repeated reservations about the arrangement that included Francis covering the costs of the private security firm in charge of watching him.  It was unclear from court records how many guards were on duty and where they were stationed, and what adjustments were made depending on his medical care. At a December 2020 court hearing, the judge learned that the home had been left unguarded for three hours while a security officer went to lunch.  Were concerns raised before he escaped?  Yes. Sammartino questioned defence attorneys who said Francis was too ill to be able to be treated by medical staff at the US Bureau of Prisons. She also was surprised to learn at one closed-door hearing that Francis’ three children and his mother were living in the main residence on the property where he was.  His attorney asked the judge to allow him to walk his children to school and go to the grocery store on occasion, but she expressed concern that he already had a lot of leniency, according to court transcripts.  Questions about whether he still warranted medical furlough came up in late 2020 after the judge was sent a letter from a San Diego surgeon who gave Francis a clean bill of health after treating him. But his attorney argued there were other health issues, and his medical furlough was extended to 23 May, 2022. No other public transcripts regarding his living situation were released.  How did he escape?  Neighbours spotted U-Haul trucks coming and going from the residence as early as Friday, two days before Francis snipped off his monitoring bracelet with heavy scissors and disappeared on Sunday. San Diego police were called out to the home nearly six hours later.  What is being done to find him?  Ten US federal, state and local agencies are searching for Francis. Mexican authorities have also been notified to be on alert for him since his home was only 40 minutes from the US-Mexico border. The US Marshals Service has put out a notice asking the public for information.  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

With nothing to gain or lose from the dead rubber, Virat Kohli and Bhuvaneshwar Kumar emerged as the most talked about – and for good reason this time.  Kohli erased doubts about his form by smashing his maiden T20I century and 71st overall. The former India skipper scored 122 runs in just 61 deliveries and helped the side to a mammoth 212 runs. Afghanistan, who were already devastated by Wednesday’s loss against Pakistan, could not reach even closer to the target.  After the match, Kohli shared a post thanking fans for keeping the trust in him. He also acknowledged the disappointing elimination from the Asia Cup and made a promise to come back harder. He wrote, “Thank you for all the love and support throughout the Asia Cup campaign. We will get better and come back stronger. Until next time.”    Fans showered numerous congratulatory messages in reply.  A user noted, “This isn’t just a comeback but replies to everyone who trolled you, questioned you, doubted you, even dared to raise questions about your place in the Indian team.”    Another fan marked it as a moment “everyone waited for since November 2019.”    An individual predicted it to be “a beginning of another peak of Virat Kohli.”    Kohli’s wife Anushka Sharma expressed her joy in pictures, with caption reading, “Forever with you through any and everything.” To this, Kohli replied with a bunch of heart emojis.  Anushka’s industry colleagues, including Varun Dhawan, Ranveer Singh and Athiya Shetty, expressed their love for the Indian cricketer.    After reaching the landmark in the 19th over, there were no animated celebrations; instead, Kohli smiled. His last century came in November 2019 during a Test match against Bangladesh.

      "body": "Kathmandu: Nepal cricket captain Sandeep Lamichhane on Friday denied allegations that he raped a 17-year-old girl and said he would go home to fight his case.  A Nepali court has issued an arrest warrant for the 22-year-old, who is playing in the Caribbean Premier League, and he has been suspended from his leadership position.  The teenage girl, along with her guardian, filed a complaint against the player earlier this week, alleging that he raped her in a hotel room in Kathmandu last month after they met and went out.  In a statement on his social media channels, Lamichhane wrote: “I am INNOCENT & keep complete belief in the respectable laws of Nepal.   “I have decided to take a leave from CPL and go back to my country within few days.  “I am ready to face all these baseless allegations. May justice be served to the innocent & right investigation to be done towards everyone involved.  “Hope the law acts equal to everyone.”  Lamichhane is currently playing for Jamaica Tallawahs in the Caribbean Premier League being held across the West Indies.  Lamichhane is a poster boy for the rise of cricket in Nepal, which gained one-day international status in 2018 but remains a long way from contesting a World Cup.  The leg-spinner’s big break came when he was snapped up by the Delhi Capitals for the lucrative Indian Premier League in 2018 and he has since been the most sought-after Nepali cricket player in international T20 leagues.  The accusations against him come after the conviction of popular Nepali actor Paul Shah this week for sexual misconduct with a minor.  He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison and ordered to pay his victim compensation.  About 2,300 rape cases were reported in Nepal in the last fiscal year, according to police, but rights workers say many more assaults go unreported.  Only a handful of women in Nepal spoke out during the #MeToo movement, and the accused have faced little or no repercussions over the allegations.  In May, hundreds protested in Kathmandu for tougher laws and enforcement in cases of sexual violence after an aspiring model posted a series of TikTok videos detailing abuse when she was a teenager.

      "body": "Virat Kohli ended a near-three-year drought by bringing up his maiden T20I hundred against Afghanistan in India’s final game of the 2022 Asia Cup on Thursday.  Kohli had not scored a century since his 136 in a day-night Test against Bangladesh in November, 2019, and by bringing up the three-figure mark for the first time in the T20I format, the former India captain — along with millions of fans — heaved a sigh of relief, having finally got the monkey off his back.  Read: Kohli’s poised 71st ton answers many questions, raises more about batting order  Besides Kohli and seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who redeemed himself for consecutive disastrous outings earlier this week with a sensational spell (5/4), opener KL Rahul too regained form in the Super 4 clash against the Afghans.  Rahul had been getting starts since his comeback from a long injury layoff, but it was only on Thursday that he could convert one into a bigger score as he dished out a 41-ball 62 that was laced with six fours and a couple of maximums.  Kohli’s success at the top of the order, however, will have raised questions about the possibility of him opening alongside skipper Rohit Sharma in India’s upcoming fixtures at home as well as in the T20 World Cup in Australia later this year. And vice-captain Rahul was asked the same after the match, to which he had a hilarious response.  “Toh mai khud baith jaun phir? (should I sit myself out then?) said Rahul when quizzed by a reporter during the post-match press conference.   “Obviously Virat Kohli scoring run is a huge bonus for the team, the way he played today I know he is very very pleased with the way he batted today — he has been working on his game for the last 2-3 series and that worked beautifully today and as a team, it is important that every player before going to the World Cup get some time in the middle.  “If you play 2-3 innings like that, your confidence will be high then it gives you the best chance to be our best selves in the World Cup, so really happy that he could play that way,” added Rahul.  Virat Kohli: ‘What surprised me was my 60s became failures… doesn’t seem to be enough’  Defending champions India bowed out of the tournament following back-to-back defeats to Pakistan and Sri Lanka — both games going down to the penultimate ball of the match — and their 101-run win over Afghanistan on Thursday ensured they avoid a bottom-placed finish in the Super 4s.

A user noted, “This isn’t just a comeback but replies to everyone who trolled you, questioned you, doubted you, even dared to raise questions about your place in the Indian team.”    Another fan marked it as a moment “everyone waited for since November 2019.”    An individual predicted it to be “a beginning of another peak of Virat Kohli.”    Kohli’s wife Anushka Sharma expressed her joy in pictures, with caption reading, “Forever with you through any and everything.” To this, Kohli replied with a bunch of heart emojis.  Anushka’s industry colleagues, including Varun Dhawan, Ranveer Singh and Athiya Shetty, expressed their love for the Indian cricketer.    After reaching the landmark in the 19th over, there were no animated celebrations; instead, Kohli smiled. His last century came in November 2019 during a Test match against Bangladesh.

      "body": "Sri Lanka and Pakistan lock horns in the final Super 4 clash of the Asia Cup in Dubai on Friday, with the fixture essentially serving as a warm-up for the final this Sunday at the same venue.  Both Sri Lanka and Pakistan have qualified for the final with two wins in as many games in the Super Four stage of the tournament, the latter having confirmed the same with a nail-biting one-wicket win over Afghanistan on Wednesday, which was ultimately marred by clashes both on the field as well as in the stands.  And a victory in the final Super 4 match does not have much context other than giving the winning team the bragging rights and some momentum heading into the summit clash. Alternately, the two sides could use the fixture as a means of testing out some of their reserves or try out some new combinations before the big game.  The Asia Cup trophy will witness a change of hands this year, with defending champions India bowing out of the tournament following defeats to Pakistan and Sri Lanka in a space of three days though they ended their campaign on a high with a 101-run hammering of Afghanistan.  Sri Lanka will be hoping to win the Asia Cup for the sixth time this Sunday in the process close the gap with India, who are the most successful side in the history of the tournament with seven titles. Pakistan, on the other hand, have won the continental title only twice — in 2000 and 2012, and will be hoping to add to their cabinet in a couple of days’ time.  Workload management  Pakistan could argue about being the worst hit among the participating teams in terms of fitness issues. The ‘Men in Green’ lost Shaheen Shah Afridi and Mohammad Wasim to injury in the build-up to the tournament, and were dealt with another blow midway with Shahnawaz Dahani getting ruled out ahead of the clash against India last Sunday.   Hasan Ali, who was included in the Pakistan squad as Mohammad Wasim’s replacement, is yet to get a game in the Asia Cup. AP  Given how overworked some of their players have been this year, maybe skipper Babar Azam and coach Saqlain Mushtaq could look at giving one of their frontline pacers a rest for the upcoming clash and finally give Hasan Ali some game time in the Asia Cup. Hasan wasn’t even included in the original squad, coming in as a replacement for Mohammad Wasim and an opportunity might just be what he needs to turn things around for himself after falling out of favour with the management.  A similar move could be suggested for one leg-spinner replacing another in the XI between Shadab Khan and Usman Qadir, the latter not having played a game since April.  Times up for Asalanka?  Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have produced a dramatic turnaround after suffering an eight-wicket hammering at the hands of Afghanistan in their opening clash, winning their next three games in style — in nail-biting fashion one might add — to confirm a 12th final appearance in 15 editions of the tournament. They were staring at an early flight back home after being reduced to 77/4 while chasing 184 in the game against Bangladesh, but their never-say-die spirit has somehow carried them through.  There are however, some areas of concern for the five-time champions heading into the business end of the tournament and a glaring one would be Charith Asalanka’s form. Asalanka’s scores so far in the tournament read 0, 1, 8 and 0 — which certainly doesn’t inspire any confidence, either from the fans or within the team.  Perhaps bringing in all-rounder Dhananjaya de Silva, who has experience batting at a number of positions including the one-down spot, could be in order come Friday.  Squads:  Sri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Charith Asalanka, Danushka Gunathilaka, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dasun Shanaka (c), Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunaratne, Maheesh Theekshana, Asitha Fernando, Dilshan Madushanka, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhananjaya de Silva, Jeffrey Vandersay, Ashen Bandara, Praveen Jayawickrama, Nuwanidu Fernando, Pramod Madushan, Nuwan Thushara, Matheesha Pathirana  Pakistan: Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Babar Azam (c), Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah, Asif Ali, Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain, Naseem Shah, Usman Qadir, Haider Ali, Hasan Ali, Shahnawaz Dahani  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

      "body": "Though Virat Kohli had been going through a century drought, Indian fans did not lose hope to see him back among the runs. Kohli did manage to live up to the expectation and has ended the ton drought with his maiden T20 International hundred on Thursday against Afghanistan at the Dubai International Stadium. The much-awaited Kohli show unsurprisingly delighted cricket enthusiasts around the globe. The stands witnessed Indian fans going crazy while celebrating the comeback of the man, who has been the sailor of the ship on India’s many successful occasions. From the tricolour-covered crowd, an old fan won hearts on social media for his special gesture to the former India skipper.  The fan, donned in the Indian jersey, was captured when vintage Kohli was raising his bat after the ton with a wide smile on his face. The clip of the moment received much attention from internet users and went viral in no time. A Twitter user has come up with a GIF of the moment for other fans who missed the notable celebration.    It was the second delivery of the 18th over when Kohli sent the ball into the crowd and completed his 71st international century. After breaching his hundred, he remained calm, looked at the sky and kissed his wedding ring to dedicate the milestone to his wife Anushka Sharma. While all of these had been happening on the field, an old man was spotted bowing down to Kohli from the stands. After showing his respect for the cricketer, he lifted up his hands and clapped with much appreciation.  The Twitter post has accumulated nearly 1,500 likes so far. The scene delighted the viewers. Users have marked the enthusiasm of the old fan while a commenter said, “Virat 2.0 starts from here.”        Kohli has come back to his much-anticipated momentum since the start of the Asia Cup. Apart from his unbeaten 61-ball 122 on Thursday, he has registered a couple of half-centuries against Hong Kong in a Group match and Pakistan in Super 4 consecutively. In his 5 Asia Cup appearances, Kohli has recorded 276 runs in total including a duck against Sri Lanka in the do-or-die game.",

      "body": "Same Time Tomorrow, the new Netflix comedy special performed by Sam Morril, arguably one of most promising comedians of this generation, is the kind of special that would have been satisfying a couple of years ago. Today, it’s just acceptable. I don’t mean to say that it’s not fun — the 45-minute intimate special is in fact stacked with good jokes. The problem is that it goes nowhere beyond delivering just jokes. If it feels underwhelming, it’s only because Morril has in the last couple of years, shot to overnight fame for being a comedian with a distinctly original voice, capable of keeping the attention spans of his audience hooked to their seats. In Same Time Tomorrow, it feels as if the comedian neglects his voice to serve some distinctly great punchlines.  These 45-minutes confirm one indisputable fact about Morril: he is one of the few comedians whose greatest strength is being a skillful storyteller. Armed with his trademark raspy voice, the New York-based comedian weaponizes language to construct his jokes, tempering it with his deadpan, wry point of view. In fact, one of the standout moments of the special involves Morril play-acting, seamlessly switching from his casual, carefree delivery style to deliver a more animated, urgent impression of porn addicts.  Should the point of a comedy special end with the comedian just succeeding in reminding his audience that he actually knows his way through the mechanics of a bit or should it also act as a playground for a comedian to keep improving his craft? To my mind, that’s the question that lies at the center of how Same Time Tomorrow plays out. There’s no doubt that Morril is a funny, accomplished comedian who can turn anything into a setup that ends with a punchline and throughout the special, he keeps confirming that.  But I’d still say it’s underwhelming given how easily Morril seems stuck to the idea that mining an off-the-limits topic for a laugh is invention enough. By that I mean, that Morril’s thoughts on abortions and trans people becoming a regular feature on every comic specials are funny and effective but they’re not imaginative. They’re aiming for the most obvious corners, rather than subverting expectations. There’s a similar approach in the way Morril constructs the special as well: it’s stacked with observations, employing crowd work as a catalyst for his comedy, culminating in a set that feels worthy for YouTube or a crowd on a night. The problem is it never comes any close to displaying the way ahead for Morril as a comedian, in the sense of becoming someone who wishes to disrupt the scene instead of adding to the current conversation.  In that sense, I suppose the biggest letdown of the special, despite the comedian’s knack at being economical, is that it feels like a comedy special designed to play to the gallery. The topics that Morril touches upon throughout the special seem formatted in a way that the comedian knows his audience will prefer. Like his bit about the idea of political correctness or outrage being actually insincere. The special name-checks every topic that finds its way in the greatest hits of any comedy special: 9/11, abortion, cancel culture, jerking off, Dave Chapelle… you get the drift. In my opinion, Same Time Tomorrow is the kind of special that is befitting of a comedian still trying to find a voice. It’s not worthy of a comedian like Morril who already possesses a voice but chooses to instead tone it down. As a result, it’s crowd-pleasing but never sharp. Morril’s appearance in That’s My Time with David Letterman earlier this year had more of a bite. There’s no reason being funny should be enough of a standard for a comedy special Morril helms.

      "body": "Suneel Darshan dropped a bomb this week. He made public what many of us have known   for a long time: that Akshay Kumar had to quit co-starring with Priyanka Chopra after a slew of hits with her, because his wife, the no-nonsense Twinkle Khanna, issued an ultimatum to her husband: either marriage or Chopra.  Suneel, who now reveals that Akshay Kumar quit Barsaat to solve ‘domestic problems’, faced a rare, though not unknown dilemma: what does a filmmaker do when co-stars suddenly fall  out during the making of a film? Suneel’s brother Dharmesh also went through a similar traumatic dilemma during the shooting of Dhadkan; Akshay Kumar split with Shilpa Shetty and decided to marry Twinkle Khanna. Luckily for Dharmesh, his film was complete when the  split happened. But he was forced to cut out a smooch between Shilpa and Akshay.  Imtiaz Ali breathed a sigh of relief  when he got to know his lead pair in Jab We Met had split only after the film was complete.  Suneel talks of Akshay Kumar’s ‘thirteenth hour’ walkout from Barsaat and the ensuing  havoc. But what about the havoc in Priyanka’s career? First Akshay, then another major superstar who was almost willing to leave his wife and children until his no-walkover wife took charge of the situation….Priyanka was banned from not only from working with this star-wife’s superstar-husband, this star-wife also made sure Priyanka was banned by all the important filmmakers of Bollywood.  When we congratulate Priyanka for heading westwards at the right time, we forget Priyanka  had no choice. Bollywood had turned its back on her. She was a hot property but only when she had Superstars to work with. With Akshay, Salman (who got pissed off when Priyanka  said not to a film he offered her) and Shah Rukh unwilling to work with her, where would Priyanka have fitted in?  The only choice Priyanka had was to produce her own films like Kangana Ranaut.  Priyanka took the better route.  When I see Priyanka Chopra looking so happy with her American husband, Nick Jonas, and daughter Malti, not to mention the dogs, I remember the whoops of cynicism and hoots of  disgust that greeted her decision to marry the American lad.   “Usski Aunty lagti hai,” said one filmmaker “friend” of Priyanka.  “I give it to six months,” a senior actress crystal-bawled.  Now she has been married for four years. No sign of wear and tear. Touchwood.  The best career decision that Priyanka made was to quit Bollywood. The best personal decision she took was to marry Nick Jonas. Believe it or not, they are happy together. I am sure the couple saw the explosive song that Suneel Darshan has unleashed on the netizens and had a good laugh.

      "body": "There’s a moment in the second season of The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives that ends up being a masterclass in finding that delicious blend of cringe and exaggeration that underlines satisfying reality television. Picture this: four 40-something celebrity wives with seemingly “fabulous lives” book themselves on a luxury glamping vacation in the jungles of Rajasthan. They’re dressed to the nines in camo-coordinated outfits tempered with perfectly blow dried hair and oversized aviators as they head out for a jungle safari ride. In the jeep, the four ladies express their excitement at spotting leopards before jokingly referring to themselves as big cats. They spot an antelope and seem awed at the wonders of nature. Then, without warning the moment completely turns on its head when they approach an Indian rock python.  “I don’t do reptiles,” one of them yells at a frantic pitch. Another just keeps screaming. Both of them keep threatening the driver to take an U-turn and head back. Their guide struggles to keep them calm while simultaneously requesting them to be quiet so as to not attract the attention of the reptile. His pleas go in vain. At this point, the two women have become masters at chaotic comedy: like 20-year-olds on their first trek in the Himalayas, they alternate between shrieking and closing their eyes; one of them starts chanting vigorously, convincing herself that “everything will be absolutely fine” even though everything is in fact, absolutely fine. The other is on the verge of tears, exclaiming “I want to go home.” Then they start bickering between themselves convinced that their lives are in immediate danger if they quieten down for even a millisecond. Far away from them, the python on the other hand, looks as relaxed and well-behaved as it could ever be.  It’s hard to tell who is watching whom at this moment — or rather, who is encroaching on whose space. But one thing is for sure, this scene doesn’t hold back in capturing the unfiltered absurdity of grown, affluent women ditching all pretense of civility, class, and charisma to reduce themselves into whimpering messes. “She was screeching like a piglet having an orgasm,” one of them tells the camera in hindsight, registering her embarrassment. In fact, much of the pleasures of the scene is just how out of place these four women looked in the jungle; a metaphor for how out-of-touch their realities are from the rest of the country.  It’s this exact cocktail of cringe and voyeurism that makes the second installment of The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives so damn engrossing. The point of reality television isn’t just to convince viewers that its subjects are worth laughing at; it’s also to make viewers want to keep watching them at all. This season, the show improves by leaps and bounds on the awkwardly-staged first season, making a solid case for these rich socialites as both, a subject of entertainment and a victim of their own entertainment. By doing so, it side-steps the crucial shortcoming of the last installment, ending up as a razor-shop examination of the distance between fame and wealth even for Bollywood wives.  Each of the four wives of the show — Neelam Kothari Soni, Maheep Kapoor, Seema Sajdeh, and Bhavana Pandey — aren’t exactly famous or relevant. At best, they’re fame-adjacent: Kothari Soni was a former actress and now jeweler; Sajdeh used to be married to Sohail Khan, famous for being Salman Khan’s brother; Kapoor is married to Sanjay Kapoor, famous for being Anil Kapoor’s brother; Bhavana Pandey is the mother of actress Ananya Pandey, who’s infamous for having less than two expressions in every movie she stars in.  Their lack of relevancy isn’t a joke; it’s a fact — they might be connected with people who are famous (case in point: Karan Johar, the producer of the series) and adhere to a lifestyle that points to affluence but it’s made clear throughout the series, that fame remains constantly out-of-their-reach even when it’s the only thing on their mind. Similarly it remains aware of their equations. As the first season underlined, these women have been friends through over two decades. But if that season was pliant enough to suggest that they’re a family, the new season takes to documenting the cracks. From the very first episode, the show doesn’t only spotlight the two factions — Pandey and Kothari Soni on one side and Kapoor and Sajdeh on the other — but it also pits them against each other for melodrama and spectacle. By being acutely aware of their place in their own celebrity circles, the second season of The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood is able to turn their stabs at both relevancy and fame as a punchline.  Each of the cleverly-constructed eight episodes of this season feature a celebrity cameo: Johar is a constant fixture as is Gauri Khan, arguably the only star wife in the whole series. There’s also Arjun Kapoor, Zoya Akhtar, Badshaah, Bobby Deol, Shweta Bachchan Nanda, Malaika Arora, Jackie Shroff, and Ranveer Singh, arguably the only entertainer in the whole series. These appearances are surely engineered to add social currency to the proceedings but what they ultimately do is reveal the hierarchies of fame — reiterating that the four wives live actually on its margins. Fame isn’t an accessory for them, it is rather a pretense.  It’s the collective commitment to this pretense that lends The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives a bingeable quality. Kapoor reprises her smart-mouth from the last season, vomiting out her usual catchphrases (“shway shway,” “fab”, “twits”, “stupid cow) but it’s her unwavering performance of celebrity that takes the cake. She carried a limited edition Bottega handbag to a brunch with the wives and their husbands that becomes the subject of mockery. Her teenage son is an aspiring actor who can’t speak Hindi. She treats her aspiring actress daughter whose movie is currently unreleased as if she’s the Meryl Streep of her generation, packing six suitcases for her before sending her off to an “acting workshop” in one episode. In another episode, she likens infidelity as a forgettable breach of trust and arranged marriage as a perfectly suitable way of coupling. Sanjay Kapoor, her husband, on his part, suggests that they’re poor people who can’t afford divorce while munching on avocado toast and lecturing his daughter about GST, both of which are markers of anything but poverty.     As this season confirms, there’s nothing more fun than watching educated, well-heeled celebrities act like prudes and victims. Kothari Soni likens her discomfort with the words “vagina” and “menopause” as an outcome of being proper; she worries about kissing on camera for the part that Akhtar has cast her for in the second season of Made in Heaven and tells Sameer Soni, her husband, that now that she will be kissing on camera, she will stop giving him grief about doing the same on screen.  Pandey on her part, keeps pretending as if Chunkey and Ananya Pandey have both been wronged by audiences, as if it’s completely unfathomable that people paying their hard-earned money to watch both of them on screen can exercise their right to express their dissatisfaction with their non-existent acting skills. Still, none of it holds a candle to Sajdeh’s comical attempts at “finding” a cause to believe in or her second-grade designs that her siblings says gives off a “serial killer vibe.” I waited with bated breath that atleast one of her friends would tell her that her designs, for the lack of a better word, suck. But I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that her celebrity friends let her believe that her designs have merit, made for absolutely irresistible television. That’s only because The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Lives has finally figured that the strength of its premise doesn’t lie in making it seem as if these four women are just like us; it’s in not trying to fool us that they’re celebrity wives.

      "body": "George Miller’s new film Three Thousand Years of Longing is an enchanting love story between Alithea – a narratology professor from London (Tilda Swinton) – and an unnamed djinn (Idris Elba)who materializes in her fancy hotel room on a conference trip to Istanbul. This is not a hook-up, sorry to disappoint you; it is a storytelling soirée. Alithea, after all, is in the business of telling stories about stories to make her living, so this adventure is right up her alley. There is no magic carpet though. They have fresh linen, room service, and bath robes.  Why does a scholar who lives alone, is deeply immersed in the life of the mind, and desires no companionship, suddenly feel the pangs of loneliness? Is her heart being enslaved by the very djinn who is supposed to act at her command and fulfil three of her deepest wishes? Why does she want to cede control and stew in the longing the djinn has felt while waiting to be released from captivity? What makes her throw caution to the wind when she is aware not only of how narrative structures work but also the fact that a wish can turn into a curse? The film allows viewers to sit with these questions, introspect, and even wrestle with them.  Miller’s screenplay, co-written with Augusta Gore, is adapted from the title story of A S Byatt’s short story collection The Djinn in the Nightingale’s Eye (1994). It has cameos from famous personalities of the past such as the Queen of Sheba (Aamito Lagum), King Solomon (Nicolas Mouawad) as well as Suleiman the Magnificent (Lachy Hulme), Sultan Murad IV (Ogulcan Arman Uslu) and Prince Mustafa (Matteo Bocelli) of the Ottoman Empire.  Apart from philosophical concerns about how desires bring fulfilment and misery, the film looks at contemporary issues such as migration and the hostility towards non-white outsiders in the United Kingdom – a country that is built on imperialism and colonial plunder. However, it is also worth watching for the visual spectacle alone as the djinn’s stories take Alithea into narrative worlds across centuries and geographies far from today’s London.  The casting of a white woman as Alithea, and a Black man as the djinn, might make viewers think about the power dynamics in their relationship through the lens of race. Is the film reinforcing colonial and orientalist stereotypes by showing a Black person as a monstrous creature whose liberation depends on a white person’s benevolence? Is it urging us to think about ethical questions related to white scholars from the global North building a career out of researching the exotic and making that intelligible to their own academic contemporaries?  There is no definitive and inarguable conclusion that viewers can come to, especially because Alithea seems aware of racism when she calls out her neighbours in London for their bigotry. The passport privilege that enables people who look like Alithea to zip in and out of countries around the world, and the racism that prevents people who look like the djinn from getting a visa stamp on their passport, is cleverly brought out in a scene at airport security wherein Alithea tries to sneak him into her carry-on baggage. It is nothing but a tiny glass bottle. This could be interpreted as comment on Brexit or Europe’s response to the refugee crisis.  On the other hand, the film shows Turkey as a land steeped in myth and mystery whereas the United Kingdom is presented as rational, scientific and modern. Does narrative convenience end up legitimizing the distinction between the so-called First World and the so-called Third World? This question is worth mulling over because politics is coded into fantasy as well.  Alithea sees supernatural beings in the audience when she is delivering her conference talk. She goes shopping at an antique store, where she is taken up by a blue bottle called the nightingale’s eye that is supposed to hold secrets from a bygone era. The djinn pops out when Alithea rinses the bottle with running water flowing out of a tap in her hotel. Interestingly, the Turkish people around her seem to have none of these experiences. Is she yet another white woman coming to a foreign land to have her epiphany and find her purpose? Is the djinn symbolic of a project that she needs to take up in order to feel useful? These are important questions in a world where rich countries bomb poor ones, and then send humanitarian aid.  Why should one read so much into a film? Can one simply not watch it as a story about two people who meet accidentally and happen to like each other enough to spend the rest of their lives together? Isn’t one being unnecessarily harsh equating a white scholar with colonizers, or even scrutinizing Alithea the way one would analyse the shenanigans of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda in Abu Dhabi in Michael Patrick King’s film Sex and the City 2?  These questions are equally valid because viewers looking for entertainment and catharsis might want to give critical thinking some rest, and just dig into their caramel popcorn.

      "body": "Ayan Mukerji’s Brahamstra is all set to change the slump at the box office. A majority of trade pundits believe this film would be a huge success.  Trade guru Taran Adarsh is expecting a box-office bonanza. “I am expecting a solid start for Brahmastra. The hype is real and humongous, the promotions are top notch and the fact is, the audience wants to watch this big screen entertainer. I am expecting Rs 25 cr+ start, given the excellent advance sales and the excitement to watch the film. The Saturday and Sunday numbers will be dependent on how the feedback is, but one thing is for sure, the start on Day 1 will be terrific. Now it is up to the film to deliver.”  Producer and trade analyst Girish Johar is more cautious. “The trend right now is that no major films are working at the box office, but having said that, if we analyse the films which have not done well, the content was not upto the mark, and if Brahmastra has good content, and from the trailers it is looking very good so far and the audiences really like it, I don’t think it should falter. It should have a good run at the box office. Advance ticket sales are also good.”  Johar feels Brahmastra may be the highest opener this year. “ It has all the ingredients to be the highest opener of 2022, so far. At the ground level, there is growing craze for the film. Also with this, a possible good start of the film, it will be the third major film of Ranbir Kapoor to have a major non-holiday start at the box office after Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani and Sanju earlier. The film has been tracking well in overseas too and team Disney/Fox have positioned the film for an extensive and wide global release. Presently it is showing all the positive CBMs (confidence-building measures) which the Hindi Fraternity needs. Looking forward to it.”  Trade analyst Atul Mohan feels Brahmastra will bring joyful tidings to the film industry. “The advance ticket sales are on fire. On Tuesday PVR released an official statement that the film has already sold over one lakh tickets in advance for the opening day and weekend .If this momentum continues we will have the biggest opener of 2022. When all astra(weapon) fail then the Brahmastra works. Biggest Day One this year is confirmed. Let’s see if it breaks biggest opening record post-pandemic for a Hindi film held by Sooryavanshi. So far from trailer and teasers we know this one is going to be a BIG-screen spectacle. The songs have already become popular.”  Adds exhibitor Akshaye Rathi, “Brahamstra is in the truest sense a spectacular epic. This is unlike anything we’ve seen coming out of Hindi cinema. The film look so international and yet so rooted to Indian mythology. Also, the 3D effects which some of us exhibitors had the privilege of watching are beyond anything attempted in our cinema. And the audience seems to be waiting for the film. Until Tuesday evening the PVR chain alone had sold a lakh tickets. I truly think Brahmastra will take an opening of at least Rs 20 crores if not much more. I think this is the movie that will revive the mojo missing in movie theatres recently.”  Subhash K Jha is a Patna-based film critic who has been writing about Bollywood for long enough to know the industry inside out.

The adorable duo was very secretive and lowkey about their relationship and when they tied the knot in December 2021, it turned out to be a great surprise for their admirers.  In one of the recent episodes of Koffee With Karan, Vicky said that in the initial phase of his career he didn’t even know that he exists for Katrina or that the actress even knows about him but after they met and bonded, it turn out to be a life-changing phase for them.  Talking about the latest episode of KWK, which was graced by Katrina along with his Phone Bhoot costars Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ishaan Khatter, it turned out to be an entertaining stuff with the trio making some interesting revelations.   Katrina revealed that she met Vicky for the first time during the Screen Awards and said, “It really was my destiny and it was meant to be.” She also revealed that the Raazi actor was not on her radar and quoted, “I maybe heard the name but there was no association. It was the most unexpected thing.”  The Tiger 3 actress revealed that Zoya Akhtar was among the first people with whom she shared that she likes Vicky. She revealed that Vicky’s love for his family, commitments, and values made her fall for him. The actress also shared a cute thing that on her birthday, Vicky did a 45-minute concert of her songs and danced on it.  Ishaan Khatter grabbed our attention when he revealed one thing about Katrina, which annoys him the most and said, “She will be speaking to you and she genuinely listens right when you speak which is lovely, when you’re having a conversation. Looking into your eyes. Except when she stops listening. And it can happen at any given point. So you’re speaking to Katrina Kaif and suddenly you’re speaking to a wall. Like there’s no one there, there’s no person. Like, she is looking at you, but she is looking through you.”  When KJo asked Ishaan about his breakup with Ananya Panday, the Dhadak star called her a wonderful person and said, “Yeah, I mean, I would hope to have her as a friend for the rest of my life. She is one of the most wonderful people I have known. She is a sweetheart, she really is. Anyone who has met her would say this. She genuinely is a sweetheart. And all pulpy questions aside, she is someone who is very dear to me and will always remain so.”  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

      "body": "Sorry, but comedies about a family death or a poverty-stricken daily wage-earner struggling to buy a new bicycle, won’t work in the movie theatres.  Re-telling of spectacular tales from Hindu mythology will.  Bigtime.  It suddenly flashed in front of me when I watched the long-awaited trailer Mani Ratnam’s Ponniyin Selvan. The images are disembodied but captivating. The intention and execution are unambiguous. This is a film designed to wean the audiences into theatres. You can’t enjoy the full ferocity of Vikram on a horseback at home. And Aishwarya Rai Bachchan looking as untarnished by the ravages of age as she was when she did Mani Ratnam’s Guru, playing the beauteous the power behind the throne would look absurdly incongruous on your home.   Ponniyin Selvan is cinema designed as an epic. You may argue that an epic is not designed. But you would be wasting your energy. That was true in the days of Pakeezah and Mughal-E-Azam. Nowadays the visual spectacle is encrypted into the narrative.  Ponniyin Selvan looks sumptuous. I have to admit I didn’t feel anything beyond the exhilaration of a clean sweep across the senses .The downpour of spectacle is the need of the hour. These Chandamama type of stories patented by Rajamouli in Baahubali and RRR, was aggravated by KGF; for, what was KGF if not a celebration of sanguinary mythology with machine guns replacing swords  What’s in a maim? A severed heard by any weapon feels just the same.  Nonetheless, I now realize that these mythological /pseudo-historicals /Primordial Epics are what will work: Karthikeya 2, and now Brahmastra followed by Ponniyin Selvan. I think the universe is trying to tell our moviemakers something.  My problem with these Nani Maa Ki Chandamama Kahaaniyan is their monotony. After a point, every battle scene from the Moghul Empire/ Hindu Dynasty feels just the same as what we saw in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Bajirao Mastani and Ashutosh Gowariker’s Jodhaa Akbar.  What gives authenticity to Mani Ratnam’s Ponniyin Selvan is not only the visual spectacle but also the authenticity of the actors. Akshay Kumar didn’t look convincing on a horse in Samrat Prithviraj. Vikram in Ponniyin Selvan does.  Oh, more thing: that voiceover is Kamal Haasan’s. I thought Mani Ratnam and Kamal Haasan were over and done with after Nayakan. Good to see them back together.

      "body": "In a sequence from Netflix’s Indian Predator: Diary of a Serial Killer a psychological expert explains “I have a natural resistance towards killing someone as do you.” It’s the kind of statement you would probably never hear in your life, nor worded as potently as the doctor does. Does killing actually require resistance as a way to establish normalcy? It’s an absurd, but deeply troubling thought. We imagine crime as the perseverance to do something outlandish, or desperate, but what if its habit. What if you’re a murderer until you actually stop living it as routine. In the second instalment of the Netflix documentary series that has quickly followed the heels of The Butcher of Delhi, this new documentary has gory, graphic details, a stirring exclusive interview, but unfortunately, nothing in sense of narrative tightness.  The documentary begins with events in 2000. Dhirendra Singh, a journalist based out of Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad) goes missing. His body is subsequently found, mutilated, the head separate from the body. An investigation into the brutal murder ensues, and it is quickly resolved with the unlikely assistance of phone-tracking (still a new-age technology in those early years). A man named Raja Kolander places a call from the deceased journalist’s home. The documentary doesn’t waste time telling us, Kolander is the man the police had been looking for. What follows is less a twisty exploration of a murky case and more a thesis on the probabilities surrounding Kolander’s existence, and more specifically his humanity.  Central to the documentary’s narrative that stretches over three episodes, is Kolander’s diary, apparently a kill-list of names he maintained. Kolander’s other crimes are discovered not because they are being investigated but because of the diary that reads and feels like a clarion call for meting out swift, immodest justice. The diary doesn’t really extrapolate, to a great extent the accusations levelled at Kolander. Hairy, discomforting details begin to emerge about the man’s past, also linking him with a double murder involving a Sumo car. It is alleged that Kolander did not just murder people, but ate them, cooked their brains and gorged on their intestines. It’s sensational, edge-of-the-seat stuff but in principle but it rarely plays out the same.  There is a lot of huffing and puffing, in a narrative that from the get-go, feels like it is stretching itself thin. For documentary format to really grab your attention there has to be a fair amount of hide-and-seek, the instinctual pretence of direction before the misdirection. In this documentary, there is none of that. The documentary is teased as a contradictory argument between differing opinions about a famed murderer and yet it falls far short of convincing us that good might exist, where evil so obviously does. Then there is the immediacy of resolution, the fact the narrative want, to swiftly move into the troubling psychology of this alleged serial killer, that it forgets to deal with the basic twisted nature of an investigation.  Sure, the resolution here is painfully simple, and you can sense the makers struggling to inject mystery into a case that seems to have unravelled on its own. But the more than the gory details of allegations that have been unproven, the narrative could have maybe also underlined the dogged police work behind the catching of a criminal. His diary, which happened to be discovered is also treated as an intriguing segue rather than a shocking discovery that fails to convince, despite some oddly plain CGI animations. The thing about serial killers is that they remain elusive despite close analysis and here a fair amount of time is expended exploring Kolander’s god(read king) complex. But you can sense the material running thin when this idea is repeated at least three times.  What works for The Diary of A Serial Killer, is its desire to venture into the politics of caste and tribals, even if to unconvincing lengths. Experts reason that Kolander’s psyche is a socio-political state rather than a physical one. He desires to rule as a mode of rebellion against the deprivation of his class and caste. It’s a fascinating theory but it amounts to little other than pejorative criminalisation. It can’t really be proven one way or the other. But none of the documentary’s wary, thin material compares to its single-most cardinal sin – the waste of an exclusive interaction with the man himself.  It’s incredible that a documentary about Kolander, that also manages to get him on camera (still serving his sentence) doesn’t want him to be the last face we remember, his words to be the last ones we hear. Kolander is twitchy, oddly comfortable and in denial and yet hardly as fascinating as the documentary wants us to think he is. Not too many times in the true-crime genre can you be within breathing space of death itself and still find a way of undermining what is clearly the greatest import of an otherwise baffling story.

While the audience is also eagerly waiting to witness a blast of entertainment from Bollywood, there weren’t many films that stood strong on their expectation. If we look at the films that have actually brought a fair return on investment on their budget would be Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri’s directorial The Kashmir Files and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 starring Kartik Aaryan. These two films are the only films that not only proved profitable for the producers but also brought back the lost charm of the theatres.  If we take a close look into its investment and return on it, The Kashmir Files were made on a budget of around 25 Cr. but collected around 340 Cr. at the global box office window. On the other hand, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 is another film that was made on a budget of around 70 Cr. but collected a huge figure of around 266 Cr. worldwide. This has certainly seen that the best and the smart investment anyone can make is on good content and which has been proved with these films excelling at the box office while side-lining all the big films with big budgets.

      "body": "#BoycottBollywood is just a passing phase. It’s a nuisance and creating negative publicity. It is agenda driven and makes more noise than reality and creates a hype around Bollywood and may not necessarily mirror the real people’s feelings for the industry. It is just a narrative that is being built to malign Bollywood. Nobody really hates Bollywood.  The attack it there, but trade experts believe that this #BoycottBollywood movement is not actually affecting business. A boycott campaign cannot cause a film to flop. It can have an effect, but it can’t stop cinema lovers to watch their favorite stars. The trollers are talking about how badly Laal Singh Chaddha and Raksha Bandhan did at the box office. Isn’t it time to also talk about the Bollywood box office hits this year like Gangubai Kathiawadi, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Jugjugg Jeeyo and Ek Villain Returns.  Buck up Bollywood we know you can do it Laal Singh Chaddha and Raksha Bandhan  Since the last few years Twitter truly has become powerful to the extent they are trying to break the careers of Bollywood actors and it has become a playground for fights, trolls, calling out people and all things distasteful. Recently as per reports, Vijay Deverakonda, who plays the protagonist in the film Liger, hit back at the trend and said, “Shouldn’t we work? We have worked hard for three years to make this cinema. Shouldn’t we release our movies? Should we sit in homes?”  Buck up Bollywood we know you can do it Liger star Vijay Devakoranda faced boycott calls for speaking up against targeting Hindi films  The year 2022, with theatres opening and the pandemic officially over, we thought Bollywood will go back to its pre pandemic glorious days.  The hate for Bollywood and the love for Sushant Sight Rajput was so high that SSR’s death brought about the systematic end of many of our favourite stars. Especially the most powerful Khans in the industry were attacked like never before. In spite of the harsh #BoycottBollywood trend which is getting harsher every day, we still have hope that Bollywood will soon regain its past glory.  According to media reports actor Suniel Shetty broke his silence on the ongoing social media boycott trends and why #BoycottBollywood have had an impact on some of the recently released films. During the event, he answered several questions asked by the media. During the event, speaking about the boycott trend he said, “We have done a lot of good work too. However, people might not be happy with the type of subjects the films are having these days, and that is why we are going through such a tough time. Hopefully, this will be considered. Initially, it felt like a one-off thing but now we have been continuously seeing that people are not coming to theatres and I can’t put my finger on a reason why and what this is happening.’’  (With added inputs from agencies)",

      "body": "The demise of business tycoon Cyrus Mistry on Sunday in a road accident near Palghar in Maharashtra on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway has once again thrown up questions about the construction of the road and its chequered past.  Mistry, the former chairman of Tata Sons and the scion of the real estate behemoth Shapoorji Pallonji Group, was travelling with three other family friends — noted gynaecologist Dr Anahita Pandole, her husband Darius Pandole and Jehangir Pandole, the brother of Darius — from Gujarat’s Udvada, a Parsi pilgrim town.  Dr Anahita Pandole was reportedly driving the Mercedes when it crashed into a divider on a bridge on the Surya river at Charoti Naka in Palghar, 120 km away from Mumbai. The car was speeding and tried to overtake another vehicle from the wrong side (the left), a police officer told PTI.  Mistry and Jehangir Pandole who were in the back seat, who weren’t wearing seat belts, died on the spot, whereas Dr Anahita Pandole and her husband Darius were admitted to Rainbow Hospital in Vapi with serious injuries. The two were later shifted to Mumbai.  News reports have confirmed that the last rites of Cyrus Mistry will be performed in Mumbai on Tuesday at Mumbai’s Worli crematorium.  As the country still reels from the shock of Cyrus Mistry’s demise, we take a closer look at the highway and why it’s considered a ‘black spot’.  A killer road  According to All India Vahan Chalak Malak Mahasangha, faulty engineering of the Mumba-Ahmedabad highway led to the fatal crash involving Cyrus Mistry.  Harbans Singh Nanade, spokesperson of the All India Vahan Chalak Malak Mahasangha, was quoted as telling mid-day, “The width of the southbound lane on Charoti flyover is 10.50 metres, has been narrowed down to seven-metre on the bridge which is built over Surya River. What kind of road engineering is this? The lane is also serpentine and the person behind the wheel cannot see the L-shaped death trap which gynaecologist (Dr Anahita Pandole) dashed into.”  “Motorists coming from Gujarat often prefer taking the right arm of the bridge as the left arm is very confusing. A new driver often misjudges the black spot and hits the L-shaped death trap. Its length is not visible to the driver. The highway authority has not put any warning signs,” Nanade was quoted as saying.  Auto journalist Bob Rupani echoed similar sentiments, saying to India Today that the Ahmedabad-Mumbai highway is one of the most crowded and badly designed highways in the country.  “The approach to the bridges on this highway need huge improvement. This highway that goes through Palghar is also used by lots of heavy trucks moving goods between Delhi and Mumbai and the truckers insist on occupying the right lane and force you to overtake dangerously from the left,” he told India Today.  Another issue with the highway is that the three-lane Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway that narrows to two lanes (where the accident took place) lacks a signboard warning motorists of the dangers ahead.  Motorists frequently driving on the highway also speak of the perils of using this road. Most complain that many parts of the highway are pockmarked and traffic discipline is very low.  Transport activist Jagdeep Desai, who often travels on the road, was quoted as telling Times of India, “Many vehicles can be seen overtaking from the left. Also, the road is uneven in some patches.”  Jainam Mehta, another road user, said on Twitter, “The entire stretch of Mumbai-Ahmedabad National Highway is in a poor condition. The major part of the road is covered in potholes. This NH 48 route is one of India’s most used/commuted highways and yet it’s in such a vulnerable state. Pathetic infrastructure. RIP #CyrusMistry.”  What the numbers say  As per data published by the National Crime Records Bureau, as many as 1.73 lakh people have lost their lives in around 4.22 lakh traffic accidents in the country in 2021 with Uttar Pradesh reporting the highest number of deaths in such mishaps at 24,711 deaths, followed by Tamil Nadu which recorded 16,685 deaths.  The report stated that the number of traffic accidents in the country increased from 3,68,828 in 2020 to 4,22,659 in 2021.  A Free Press Journal report added that in the past two years, 100 people have died and nearly 50 have sustained injuries between Manor (Palghar) and Achad (Gujarat) on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway. This 52-km stretch has nearly a dozen accident spots, including the bridge over Surya river.  Globally, India accounts for 11 per cent of road traffic fatalities with just two per cent of vehicle share.  This clearly shows that India still struggles with road safety issues such as check on over-speeding, wearing of seat belts for rear passengers and inconsistent road designs.  Police speak  Traffic police officials have, however, stated that the road design wasn’t responsible for the accident in which Cyrus Mistry lost his life and added that it was over speeding, which caused the crash.  Officials have stated that the site is not accident-prone and also does not feature in the list of “black spots” where fatal accidents have taken place before.  “We checked the earlier accidents records but none had taken place on the spot where this one happened. It looks like the car was speeding and there was an error in the judgement of the driver while taking the bridge. Since the road narrowed to two lanes from three, the driver could not shift from left to right and lost control of the wheel and rammed into the divider,” said a police officer.

      "body": "New Delhi: A day after he met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday landed at the door of CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury in a bid to unite the Opposition to unseat the saffron party from power at the Centre.  Emerging out of the meeting with Yechury, Kumar reiterated he had no prime ministerial ambitions.  “I am not even the claimant, I don’t even desire it,” said the Bihar chief minister.  He said in the meeting we discussed that if Opposition parties can unite it will be a step in the right direction.  “We have discussed that if the Left parties, regional parties in different states, and the Congress come together then it will be a huge matter,” he said   Welcoming Kumar to his office, Yechury said that coming together of the Opposition parties is a positive sign for the national politics.  “We welcome that he (Nitish Kumar) came to this office once again. This is a positive sign for the politics in the country. Opposition parties have to save the country and Constitution, together,” added Yechury.   After meeting Yechury, Kumar is scheduled to visit CPI headquarters where he will hold talks with general secretary D Raja.  Kumar will also meet his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal later in the day followed by a meeting with former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala.  Kumar, who snapped ties with the BJP last month, on Monday met Rahul Gandhi and the two leaders are learnt to have discussed the current political situation in the country and ways to ensure Opposition unity.  Kumar also met Janata Dal (Secular) chief H D Kumaraswamy at the latter’s residence.  The meeting between Gandhi and Kumar at the former Congress chief’s residence lasted almost an hour. Kumar was accompanied by Bihar Water Resources Minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Sanjay Kumar Jha.  This is the first meeting between Gandhi and Kumar since the latter walked out of the NDA in Bihar and formed a ‘Mahagathbandhan’ government with RJD, Congress and outside support of the Left.

      "body": "Ahmedabad: The Congress will give priority to youth and women in ticket distribution for the Gujarat Assembly elections due later this year, state party’s screening committee chairman Ramesh Chennithala said on Tuesday.  He said the Congress will also give a chance to “new faces” in the state polls.  Last month, the All India Congress Committee constituted a three-member screening committee to shortlist party candidates for the Gujarat polls due in December this year.  Chennithala has been appointed as the committee’s chairman and Maharashtra Congress leader Shivajirao Moghe and former Delhi MLA Jai Kishan are its members.  Gujarat Congress in-charge Raghu Sharma, state party president Jagdish Thakor and Leader of Opposition Sukhram Rathva are ex-officio members of the screening committee.  On Monday evening, the screening committee members held a joint meeting with the Congress’s Pradesh Election Committee, comprising 39 members including Sharma and Thakor, after Rahul Gandhi’s address to the booth-level workers in Ahmedabad.  “This time, we will give priority to new faces, youth and women in ticket distribution. Our list of candidates for the Gujarat polls this time will be an impressive one,” Chennithala told reporters here ahead of another meeting of the screening committee on Tuesday.  Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said, “Yesterday’s joint-meeting was more about getting familiar with each other and discussing various criteria which will be applied to finalise candidates.”  On Tuesday, the screening committee will meet senior leaders and party in-charge of each Assembly seat to understand the ground situation before finalising the candidates, he said.  For the 182-member Assembly, the Congress is expected to announce its first list of candidates by September-end.  The new entrant Aam Aadmi Party has already declared 19 candidates.  The ruling BJP has not announced any candidate so far.  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

      "body": "New Delhi: Former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar and Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday alleged that the state’s Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is on a political tour in the national capital while the people of Bihar have been facing a flood.  In a conversation with ANI, Sushil Modi said that Bihar is drowning in floods and the Chief Minister has arrived National Capital on political Tourism. He counted the previous arrivals of the CMs of other states to Delhi by mentioning that before this, Telangana CM K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) travelled to six states while West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee also camped in Delhi many times. “Now Nitish ji has come, the Lok Sabha election is approaching so Nitish Kumar has come to Delhi on political tourism,” he said.  The water level of River Ganga was reportedly increasing on Saturday, which resulted in flood situations in Bhagalpur city as it even entered the university and colleges.  “This is not going to yield any results and these people have the mindset of the 90s, they repeatedly remember the government of United Front, National Front, Deve Gowda, Inder Kumar Gujral. India has come a long way from that era but they are still living in the 90s mentality. Left Parties have lost their existence from the entire country except for Kerala,” the Rajya Sabha MP told ANI.  On Nitish Kumar saying that he is not even a claimant and he does not even desire the PM candidature, BJP’s Upper House MP from Bihar further said, “See, he is excited to become the Prime Minister of India (Mann me to laddu fut raha hai PM banne ke liye ) as they are raising slogans, installing posters but he has come on the back foot and they feel that if he would speak for the Prime Minister’s post from now on, a problem might arise for non accepting him. Will Arvind Kejriwal accept Rahul Gandhi? Will anyone accepts Mamata Banerjee? Who will accept Nitish Kumar?” he added.  Various posters of Nitish Kumar projecting him as a prime ministerial candidate in the 2024 Lok Sabha election were seen in Patna on Thursday, which promised good governance, and gave the slogan ‘Pradesh mein dikha, desh mein dikhega’.  Taking a swipe at BJP, another poster carried the caption, “Jumla Nahi Haqiqat Hai” (No lies only reality). Sushil Modi further asserted, “This is not the BJP of 2014, this is the BJP of 2024 and the popularity of Narendra Modi is increasing continuously so Nitish Kumar would not be able to unite the opposition parties even if he puts in lakhs of efforts.”  “He has come to Delhi on political tourism to stay in the media,” Former Deputy CM Bihar added.  Nitish Kumar arrived Delhi on Monday afternoon to work for Opposition unity for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections as it is his first visit after he broke his alliance with the BJP and joined hands with Tejashwi Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Congress and other parties to form a ‘Mahagathbandhan’ government in Bihar.

      "body": "Chandigarh: Raising strong concerns over former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda meeting Ghulam Nabi Azad, who quit the party blaming its leadership, senior Congress leader Kumari Selja has said the move confuses and disheartens the party rank and file.  Selja, a Congress Working Committee (CWC) member and former president of the party’s Haryana unit, is learnt to have lodged a complaint against Hooda, also the Leader of Opposition in the state, with the party high command and also demanded a show cause notice against him.  Apart from Hooda, two other members of the G-23 Anand Sharma and Prithviraj Chavan on Tuesday met Azad at his Delhi residence, days after the leader from Jammu and Kashmir resigned from the party, blaming its leadership.  Selja has raised the matter with some senior party leaders, including All India Congress Committee Haryana in-charge Vivek Bansal.  When asked for a comment, Selja told PTI over the phone on Thursday, “I have said that Mr Hooda going there and meeting Mr Azad when he has left the party, blamed the leadership and even made personal comments against our leaders, disheartens the party rank and file and also confuses them”.  “He (Azad) has chosen a path and left the party. But once the die is cast, the person has left the party and has already announced floating his own party, what is the point of him (Hooda’s) going to his Azad’s house,” she sought to know.  Selja, considered Hooda’s bete noire, is also learnt to have told the party high command that such a development was not acceptable even though the former Haryana chief minister had been given a free hand in running the affairs of the Congress’ state unit.  Hooda is among the G-23 leaders who had in a letter to the Congress president in August 2020 sought an organisational overhaul and elections at all levels.  He, along with Sharma and Chavan are learnt to have held discussions with Azad regarding the G-23’s future strategy.  The Congress had in April revamped its Haryana unit, appointing former legislator and Hooda loyalist Udai Bhan as its president, replacing Selja, who was later made a CWC member.  As part of the reorganisation, the party had also appointed four working presidents.  Hooda’s son Deepender Singh Hooda is a Rajya Sabha MP.

      "updateddate": "September 06, 2022 17:54:49 IST",
      "body": "A Supreme Court committee, which enquired into a security lapse after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s convoy stuck on a flyover in Punjab on 5 January 2022 blamed the Ferozepur SSP saying he failed to discharge his duty to maintain law and order.  “He failed to do this even though sufficient force was available and even though he was informed two hours before, that the Prime Minister will enter that route,” said the CJI after perusing the report of the committee which was headed by a former apex court judge, Justice Indu Malhotra.  The court said it would forward the report to the Centre for appropriate action. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, had contended during the hearing of the case that there had been a “complete intelligence failure” on the part of the Punjab government particularly the erstwhile Charanjit Singh Channi-led dispensation of the Congress.  While the court may have only indicted the Ferozepur SSP, the fact of the matter is, the SSP in this case was supposed to have been directly reporting to the chief minister at that time, Channi, in this case. All preparations and protocol-related matters pertaining to the prime minister’s visit were directly supervised by the then chief minister (Channi), with the SSP being just a small cog in the wheel. That being the case, there can be no doubt about the fact that the erstwhile Congress regime under Channi failed to contain a massive security lapse, which could have escalated into something far more serious.  The terminal decline of the Congress is not limited only to debilitating electoral debacles in the last seven years, but the downhill journey is more about the ethical lapse within the party. Only a party that has no political propriety will choose to wilfully undermine the office of a democratically elected prime minister and worse still, will make brazen attempts to justify in the most cavalier manner, an attempt to compromise the security of the prime minister.  Let us get straight to the moot issue at hand here. The prime minister’s itinerary and the minutest security details are very meticulously discussed, finalised and documented by the Central agencies in close coordination with the SPG. The entire exercise involves Central and state agencies. In a “major security lapse”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s convoy was stranded on a Bhatinda flyover, en route to Hussainiwala in Ferozepur district due to a blockade by protesters on 5 January 2022. The incident forced the prime minister to cancel his rally and other development oriented projects of over Rs 42,000 crore that were to be flagged off in poll-bound Punjab. While words like security lapse and security breach were repeatedly used by various stakeholders, post the 5 January incident, the hard truth is, the SPG is only responsible as per the Blue Book, for proximate security, which basically means the immediate cordon around the prime minister.  The SPG elite commando force forms the innermost security cordon around the prime minister wherever he goes, but even the perimeter of that cordon is decided by the respective state government when the prime minister visits any given state. While the SPG has the responsibility for the prime minister’s security, given that the perimeter routes and the areas which the prime minister visits are secured by the concerned state police, it is clear that then chief minister Channi, his entire state machinery and the DGP of Punjab, failed miserably in performing their duties. What made it even worse was Channi’s callous attitude, post the security sabotage. Why did then chief minister Channi and the Congress fail to take ownership of the massive security failure surrounding the prime minister?  That the prime minister’s security was not merely breached in this case, but that there was a sabotage bordering on criminal conspiracy, is evident from the fact that within less than 100 meters of the buffer zone, a large group of protesters had gathered. Who allowed these miscreants and vandals from BKU (Krantikari), which had been banned in 2014 for having links with Maoists, to gather there, near the buffer zone, right on the eve of prine minister’s convoy, that was scheduled to pass through that particular area? Who leaked the itinerary of the prime minister? If it takes between 45 minutes to an hour to mobilise protesters, as is being suggested by various police officials, how is it that for an hour when these protesters were being mobilised, the Punjab Police, was unaware? Why did the DGP give wrong inputs to the SPG that the area from which prime minister’s convoy was slated to pass through, had been properly sanitized? Did the senior officials of Punjab Police not see the crowd of vandals that had gathered near the Bhatinda flyover, before blatantly lying to the SPG that the said area was safe?  Why did then chief minister Channi not respond to umpteen efforts that were made via telephone calls and otherwise, post the dangerous and shameful security breach? Finally, the buck stops at the doorstep of the chief minister, in matters pertaining to law and order in that given state, as per the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. What kept the then chief minister Channi so busy, that he chose to wilfully and deliberately not respond to phone calls, from the PMO? How can the chief minister of a state blatantly and deliberately not respond to phone calls, in matters pertaining to security of the highest elected office of the land, the Office of the Prime Minister, in this case?\\  The PMO is an institution in itself and this was not just about the Prime Minister’s security alone. By putting to risk the prime minister, why did Channi choose to risk the security of the entire nation? A prime minister eventually represents the popular will of the entire nation via a democratic process. On whose behest did Channi, put in harm’s way, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, in this case? How is it that each time Rahul Gandhi vanishes and goes abroad, some or the other untoward incident happens in India? Was there a Pakistani or Khalistani element in this conspiracy to sabotage the prime minister’s security? Why did Rahul Gandhi not offer sympathy or empathy which is what a mature Opposition leader is expected to do, post such a massive security lapse, in a state where the Congress was in power? But then, maturity is anathema to Rahul Gandhi and he has shown his political immaturity bordering on the vile, on more than one occasion.  Right from the word go,Channi flouted every rule in the rulebook. Why did Channi,the Punjab DGP or Punjab’s Chief Secretary who directly reported into then CM Channi,not receive Prime Minister Modi at the Airport? Channi’s lame excuse that he had been in close contact with a Covid positive person and hence he avoided receiving the PM,was a snarky lie.If COVID protocol is indeed something Channi was so worried about,why did he address an over 30 minute long press conference,without even wearing a mask,the very same day? If COVID protocol weighed on Channi’s mind,why was he hobnobbing with reporters from a media-house,within less than 24 hours of the “security breach”? Barely 14 days prior to the PM’s visit on Jan 5, 2022,there was a powerful bomb blast within the premises of the Ludhiana Court.  Given that then chief minister Channi was well aware of the hostile scenario prevalent in and around Ferozepur, why did Channi not ensure stringent security? Security apparatus should have, in fact, been doubled up on a war footing ahead of the prime minister’s visit. Instead, the prime minister’s safety, security and stature were shamefully compromised by the former Chief Minister of Punjab, in a glaring reminder of how the Congress party is driven by nothing but visceral hate for Prime Minister Modi.This visceral angst and animosity for Modi is driven by the Congress Party’s growing political irrelevance and dwindling political fortunes,given the resounding defeats that the Congress faced both in the Lok Sabha 2014 and 2019 elections.  How prime minister’s security is planned? An Advanced Security Liaison (ASL) is carried out by the SPG which requires maintaining every minute detail of the prime minister’s itinerary. This exercise involves officials of the Intelligence Bureau in the concerned state, DGP and other police officials and the district magistrate of the concerned district. Whenever the prime minister visits a state, the local police maintain this minute-to-minute programme under the complete supervision and knowledge of the concerned chief minister of the concerned state. Hence for Channi (then, the chief minister), to feign ignorance about prime minister’s itinerary and any change in plans thereof, smacks of his incompetence and devious sense of entitlement, bordering on recklessness.  As part of the ASL, the entire route of the prime minister’s entourage and the venue is supposed to be completely sanitized by the state police force and clearance is issued by the head of state DGP, who also gives necessary inputs to the SPG. Other safety measures by the state police, entail anti-sabotage checks, frisking of people who would be allowed to sit in close proximity to the prime minister and related measures. Clearly, the Punjab DGP, his team and ex-chief minister Channi, failed woefully on all these counts.  Broad guidelines have been laid down in what is referred to as the SPG’s Blue Book. Three days before any planned visit, the SPG officials carry out a mandatory ASL with everyone involved in securing the event. Once the prime minister’s itinerary is discussed and an ASL report is prepared, all security arrangements are made by the concerned state, keeping the SPG informed. According to the laid down rules, an alternative arrangement during a VVIP’s visit has to be ensured. The internal memos written by ADG law and order, Punjab, to senior state police officials on the 1, 2 and 4 of January 2022, clearly show that a contingency plan had been made in case the prime minister chose to travel not by helicopter, but by road. Why then did Channi lie that there was no alternative contingency plan and that the security lapse happened, as the prime minister had not informed about a change in his plan?  To sum up, the entire security sabotage, due to rain and poor visibility, the prime minister waited for about 20 minutes for the weather to clear out. When the weather did not improve, it was decided that he would visit the National Martyrs Memorial via road, which would take more than two hours. He proceeded to travel by road after necessary confirmation of necessary security arrangements by the Punjab Police DGP.  Around 30 kilometres away from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala, when the prime minister’s convoy reached a flyover, it was found that the road was blocked by some protestors. The prime minister was stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes. This was a major lapse in the security of the prime minister as anything could have happened in those crucial 20 minutes.  Undoubtedly, the people of India will never forgive the withered and jaded Congress party for doing what it did on 5 January 2022. As if the security sabotage was not embarrassing enough, Channi was completely clueless and unwilling to answer why only a lame FIR under Section 283 of the IPC, which only entails a measly fine of Rs 200, was filed ?Is Prime Minister Modi’s life worth only Rs 200? Why did it take the police two full days to file the FIR? Why did the police reach the venue of the security sabotage after the prime minister had left? Should the police not have been there much earlier to ensure the vandals were nabbed?  If Channi claims that 10,000 policemen were deployed at the said place where the security sabotage occurred, how is it that these 10,000 policemen had no inkling of who these 150 people were against whom an FIR was eventually filed? Was it not the job of the police to find out identities of these 150 supposedly “unknown” men? If these men were indeed unknown, why were Punjab Police officials seen chatting, merrymaking and sipping tea with these vandals, all of which was evident on camera? Does that imply that this murderous mob of 150 “unknown” people was in collusion with the Punjab Police?  No discussion on the consistent, albeit failed attempts to sabotage and subvert democracy by the Congress establishment will be complete without discussing the myriad, mysterious deaths of top politicians over the decades that show the Congress in very poor light. Be it Syama Prasad Mukherjee’s mysterious death under detention in 1953, the death of former Punjab chief Minister, Partap Singh Kairon in 1965, Lal Bahadur Shastri’s demise in 1966, a day after he signed the Tashkent agreement, the death of LN Mishra who was railways minister under Indira Gandhi in 1975,or for that matter the mysterious death of Congress leader Madhavrao Scindia in a chopper crash near Mainpuri  in 2001, the Congress party has a lot to explain and account for.  Coming back to Punjab, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed immense grace and displayed exemplary dignity in the face of grave provocation and challenging circumstances, the Congress has dug its own grave by mocking democratic institutions. The Sikhs are a highly patriotic bunch of people whose valiant sacrifices are not lost on anyone. The anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984 till date, remains one of the most horrific legacies of the Congress party.  Another 1984 moment was deftly averted on 5 January, 2022 only due to the political wisdom, sagacity and far sightedness of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has shown in more ways than one, that restraint at times, speaks far louder than reaction. Be it bringing back three copies of the Guru Granth Sahib in a special flight from Kabul to New Delhi in August 2021 or announcing the decision to repeal farm laws on 19 November, 2021 on the day of Guru Nanak Jayanti (Gupurab), Prime Minister Modi’s love for Sikh traditions and culture, are amply evident.  As for the Congress, what it has failed to win by the ballot post 2014, it seeks to win by the bullet, forgetting that the New India under Modi is resilient, unputdownable and unwilling to be bullied by a family that has outlived its utility in Indian politics.

      "body": "J Sai Deepak’s India, Bharat and Pakistan: The Constitutional Journey of a Sandwiched Civilisation — his second book in the three-volume Bharat series — takes off exactly from where India That Is Bharat ends. While the first book analyses the influence of European ‘colonial consciousness’ — the author calls it ‘coloniality’ — on India, Indians and the Indian Constitution, the second one explores the influence of European and Middle Eastern colonialities, often working in tandem with the larger objective of hurting Bharat and its civilisational moorings.  Five broad strands can be discerned while reading Sai Deepak’s new book. First and foremost, it tells us matter of factly that while India’s enemies, especially of the Islamist variety, are crystal clear about their objectives vis-à-vis Bharat, the same can hardly be said about the latter. Jihadi foot soldiers and their patrons never work in an ideological vacuum and have always been religiously and historically alive to their objective, which they see as divinely ordained.  The author, for instance, makes a pertinent observation about Syed Ahmad Barelvi (1786-1831), who “is credited with laying the foundations for a pan-India Wahhabi network in a systematic manner”. He writes how in late 1826, Barelvi reached Ghazni and camped at the mausoleum of Mahmud Ghaznavi, the plunderer and destroyer of Somnath. “That Barelvi who lived in the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries felt a kinship with Mahmud of Ghazni who lived eight centuries before him should come as no surprise since it demonstrates the ability of Middle Eastern coloniality to see common cause for Islam, regardless of region, ethnicity or nationality.”  Barelvi is a highly reverential figure among Islamist terrorists of the day. Pakistani historian Ayesha Jalal writes in Partisans of Allah: Jihad in South Asia: “Balakot is in many ways the epicentre of jihad in South Asia… It is also a point of entry into the history of jihad, struggle in the way of Allah, in the subcontinent. It was here that Sayyid Ahmad of Rai Bareilly (1786-1831) and Shah Ismail (1779-1831), quintessential Islamic warriors in South Asian Muslim consciousness, fell in battle against the Sikhs on 6 May 1831.”  Is it any surprise that in 2019 when the Narendra Modi government decided to conduct surgical airstrikes on Pakistan-based terrorist camps — in response to the Pulwama suicide bombing that led to the killing of 40 Indian soldiers — Balakot invariably became the preferred choice? It was, in a way, also aimed at sending a message loud and clear: That India understands the true nature of jihadi terrorism emanating from Pakistan. That if “the followers of Barelvi have not forgotten their history” and kept Balakot high on the jihadi map, then India too is capable enough to strike at the heart of the Islamist terror.  The second point that comes out prominently in the book is that Islamists are always in a state of warfare — there may be occasional ‘ceasefires’ but that’s strategic and transitory in nature — while the victims find themselves in a denial mode. This is partly because a Muslim (most of them being converts) is inherently at war with his own identity and past. No wonder, Pakistan, which should ideally be proud of its historic connections with the Indus-Saraswati civilisation, officially calls Mohammed-bin-Qasim, the Arab invader who vandalised Sindh in 712 AD, its “first citizen”. This “mangling of history” or the “fundamental rage” against one’s own past is the outcome of the Arab/Middle Eastern coloniality that makes the convert recast his identity based on his new religious outlook and, worse, go berserk against his old cultural, civilisational past. He is forever battle-ready till “Dar-ul-Harb” is turned into “Dar-ul-Islam”.  This phenomenon works like a subterranean stream, flowing silently and in hiding, but it bursts out in the open when the demography of an area turns to the advantage of the Ummah. Sai Deepak examines some of the fault lines — from Kohat and Balakot in the west to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Dacca (now Dhaka) in the east, and from Deoband and Bareilly in the north to Hyderabad and Malabar in the south. The 1921-22 Moplah rebellion — which Sai Deepak calls an “outrage” — is a classic case of Islamists being ever-ready for the forever war: Unlike the popular perception, the 1921-22 ‘outrage’, which our ‘eminent’ historians see through an agrarian crisis prism, was not an aberration.  “In view of the near-unbroken violent communal history of the place, which dates back, to the very least, to Tipu Sultan’s invasion of the Malabar, and earlier by his father Hyder Ali, it would be factually incorrect to pin the blame for the outrage entirely on the Khilafat movement,” the author writes. He then quotes John J Banninga’s 1923 article, ‘The Moplah Rebellion of 1921’, according to which there were at least 51 outbreaks of Moplah fanaticism in 100 years leading up to the 1921 massacre. For the bleeding heart liberals, who never tire of inventing and invoking “Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb”, this is a cautionary tale of one-sided Hindu generosity gone horribly wrong. The Moplahs, if a prominent local legend is to be believed, were the descendants of Arab traders who married the locals of Malabar. As a minority, they enjoyed the freedom to pursue their faith, but when they became numerically superior in the region they refused to return the favour!  The third strand coming out of the book is the Islamist strategy to make the entire community a stakeholder in their jihadi acts of omissions and commissions — this works as a bulwark against occasional military setbacks and leadership losses. They may suffer massive defeats, face some major leadership casualties, but that would never mean the end of their jihadi agenda. It would just mark a period of pause for a decade or two. Sai Deepak finds this Islamist tendency “of investing in the community by making its members stakeholders through participation” similar to the concept of “Raktabija” in the Hindu Puranas. The erstwhile British empire of India faced this problem in dealing with the Wahhabis and the Islamists of other hues. The Americans and others are dealing with this now against the Taliban, Al Qaeda, ISIS and others.  The fourth point, an extension of the third, makes a strong case for tackling the Islamist terror with an iron fist, as the British had done vis-à-vis the Wahhabis and their ilk. The British came up with all sort of legal and administrative provisions, such as the sedition act, to deal with the jihadi menace, especially growing in the north-western part of the subcontinent. Given the Islamist tendency to make the community stakeholders, one must understand that being tough alone won’t be good enough. Here, India can take a cue from how Maharaja Ranjit Singh dealt with — and subdued — his immediate western neighbours. Stick and carrot should go hand in hand. For all the centripetal tendencies of Islam, an equally strong centrifugal force operated among the tribal population in the subcontinent’s north-western territories.  Last but not the least, the book is a vindication of the fact that a liberal class exists in the Muslim community, but only till it doesn’t come face to face with Islamists. The moment the jihadis take up an issue — we saw this in post-Independence India too, whether during the Shah Bano and Salman Rushdie episodes or in the recent triple talaq and hijab issues. It was no different in the colonial era as well. Mohammed Ali Jinnah would drink alcohol, eat pork, smoke 50 cigarettes a day, and dress like an English gentleman — yet this never came in his way of taking up the Pakistan project. He had also defended in court the killer of a Hindu publisher who was assassinated for publishing a “blasphemous” book on the Prophet!  Sai Deepak adds to this the name of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, independent India’s first education minister. Citing Ayesha Jalal, he informs how Jamal al-Din al-Afghani’s ideas of pan-Islamism and jihad as an instrument against the West among Muslims in India can be attributed to Azad, who also defended the Khilafat movement purely from the Quranic standpoint. “Citing the Islamic Prophet’s pact with the Jews in 622 CE, Azad made the case that it was Quranic to collaborate with one group of non-Muslims, namely the Hindus, to act against another group of non-Muslims, namely the British,” Sai Deepak writes.  This book, like the previous one in the Bharat series, discusses with profound empathy, rigorous research and academic excellence the impact of coloniality — both European and Middle Eastern — on India, Indians and the Indian Constitution. The discourse may not be over yet, but it’s heartening to see one of the world’s oldest civilisations — deeply wounded and deliberately pushed into the area of darkness by a number of forces and factors — finally coming out of slumber to heal its tampered mind, and not just the body. It’s still a long journey back to apogee, but then time has never been too much of an issue for this timeless civilisation.  The author is Opinion Editor, Firstpost and News18.

      "body": "The United Kingdom economy is tanking. The Pound Sterling is at a historical low and inflation is at a 40-year high. There is a cost of living and energy price crisis. The crisis is not just in household energy costs that have doubled, but also in industry, such as steel, that uses a lot of electricity and fuel. They are all crying out for more subsidies on top of the subsidies they have already been given. Economists are warning of the medium-term consequences of this tsunami of subsidies given and being contemplated.  Supporting American President Joe Biden and the EU’s Ukraine War efforts have been very costly for Britain, coming on top of the costs of exiting the EU, and Covid-19. Politically, Protestant Northern Ireland too is chafing at the bit even as informal and localised talks are on to unify with Catholic Eire which is part of the EU.  Boris Johnson’s popularity and jaunty premiership had no impact on the British economy, except for the damage caused by Brexit and the lack of ready success to replace markets lost as a consequence. A Free Trade Agreement with India is moving at a snail’s pace because of British demands that are no longer deemed acceptable. Another, a work in progress with the United States is not yielding results either.  The economy has not improved, even with former investment banker Rishi Sunak running it as Chancellor of the Exchequer. And this may have been a major dampener for his chances to replace Johnson. And now, in any event, it’s the turn of Liz Truss.  Johnson and Truss have been congratulating each other after the results of the Conservative Party internal vote from 160,000 members, some accounts say 200,000 voters, came in on Monday the 5th. Johnson sees Sunak as a backstabber and has backed Truss all the way. Meanwhile, Truss has already acquired a description in the media: Shapeshifter. No point knocking it. It is a valuable political trait.  From a person who voted against leaving the EU in the referendum, she quickly changed over to become a staunch Brexiteer in league with Boris Johnson. In the conservative party governments even prior to Johnson’s term, Truss, now 47, has held a variety of portfolios over the last decade. She goes to the prime ministership after being the foreign secretary.  She started off her political career earlier, not in the Labour Party but in the middle-of-the-road-with-pink-tinges Liberal Democrats. And now she is the Conservative prime minister, only the third lady to win the job after Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May.  One of her first pass-the-buck statements even before taking over on Tuesday was to say that fixing inflation was the Bank of England’s job. Meaning that when the Bank of England raises interest rates to curb inflation, it won’t be Truss who did it. There is some debate on the degree of autonomy the Bank of England and its Governor presently enjoy, but it is difficult to see how the prime minister could evade responsibility for such an important matter. Still, Truss must be hoping for the best.  She has announced, during the campaign against Rishi Sunak, that she would cut taxes. Sunak mocked her for this, suggesting it was a fantasy, because the government coffers are highly stressed. It was one of the reasons Sunak could do little to alleviate national distress as Chancellor. But it is this Truss pledge, to cut taxes, that probably won her the election. She won a tad above 57 percent of the vote (81,326) to Sunak’s 42 percent plus (60,399).  The margin of the win however was lower than any for the conservative party leadership in the 21st century. Almost 20 percent of those eligible did not vote, making Truss’ win representative of under 50 percent of the membership. Sunak did very well with the conservative party voters, despite being a ‘brown boy’. Others have called Sunak, the richest MP in Britain currently, as something of an international smoothie.  The toffs in the City, ‘remainers’ mostly, understood what Sunak was saying, about controlling inflation being the first task. But Conservative voters in the countryside liked the sound of lower taxes.  Truss reiterated she would cut taxes again after winning the vote. This probably means no new corporation taxes for a start, and a scrapping of the green energy levies that will cost the exchequer more than 20 billion pounds sterling.  Several analysts think cutting taxes and subsidising energy costs and stressed businesses about to fail, will only fuel more inflation. There is already a run to dump the Pound Sterling and government bonds.  Liz Truss will probably pick African-origin Kwasi Kwarteng, currently business secretary, for her finance minister to replace Sunak. Kwarteng said that there was likely to be some fiscal loosening, but that it would be done in a responsible way. He said that he did not know if he was going to be Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Energy prices have doubled household energy bills, likely to be up another 80 percent by October, and even higher by 2023. There was a large subsidy to cushion the public against high energy prices given out in May 2022, but it seems to be inadequate. More energy subsidies are likely to be added. Many sectors of the British economy are planning to go on strike demanding government subsidies in order to survive as well.  Meanwhile, inflation has made food items very expensive. Ditto hotels, services, all things. This is certainly not a time for Indians to visit the UK with the rupee hovering at 80 to the US dollar.  Truss is on record stating she will increase Britain’s defence spending. With what money though? From all this, it is clear that her tenure in 10, Downing Street is likely to feature a higher fiscal deficit, because there are no resources in reserve, putting further pressure on the economy. However, it is a difficult time and the options available to her to provide quick relief are extremely limited.  The task may well be to out-labour-the-labour-party, with populist measures. This will reduce the inherited burden of less than dynamic conservative party economic policies over the last 12 years.  What next in foreign policy? Britain is closely allied to the US in this regard and will probably benefit India strategically and militarily via AUKUS, and a greater naval presence in our region. India will definitely be interested in nuclear-powered engine technology for our navy, amongst other high technology strategic military know-how transfers from Britain. Will Britain under Truss deliver?  The good thing for India is that we have other options, including France, the US, Japan, and Russia, for state-of-the-art technology. In other military cooperation, Spain seems keen in aatmanirbhar areas including C295 aircraft from Airbus Spain to replace our ageing Avros.  Whether Truss will take stern trade measures against China, to follow on from America, and warm up to Taiwan also, it seems quite likely.  Since Truss is a continuation of the Johnson line of thinking, it is expected that impediments in the way of a Free Trade Agreement with India should be removed by sometime in 2023, if not quite by Diwali 2022 as Boris Johnson had hoped.  For now, the less than threatening demeanour of Liz Truss, though she can be strident too, maybe a reassuring factor in European politics. The provocations against Russia however may have to be toned down in favour of the long haul in Ukraine.  The writer is a Delhi-based political commentator. Views expressed are personal.

      "body": "Over this weekend, India has watched four very wealthy, very privileged women with filmy connections on Netflix. Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives Season 2, which has little to offer as entertainment or storytelling, is the most watched show on the OTT platform currently.  It has probably aided the streaming platform add subscribers, a boost that Netflix India needs despite its many Bollywood based content pieces.  Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives is not alone in getting viewership basis lives of super wealthy Indians. This microscopic segment of our country folk that live overseas in mansions, brownstones and gardened bungalows, alongside the gilded existences of the UHNI (Ultra High Net Worth Individual) in India, spend mega bucks and evidently, endless amounts of time pursuing an ideal, super-sized wedding. The series- that simply rests on the premise of rich people looking for other rich people to get married, albeit with preset criteria- is one of the most successful Indian OTT shows ever. It has fascinated viewers in UK, Europe, North America because of the unique Indian concept- arranged marriage before love, a constructed fusion of hearts, minds and bodies that may or may not lead to love.  How the Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives and Indian Matchmaking show Indias fascination with super wealthy lives The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives  Both shows are often called ideal for ‘cringe binge’ by reviewers and industry commentators. Question is, who is bingeing? Why are they bingeing? Are they really cringing or are they just playing along with peers and social circles?  The consistent success that both these series have achieved can’t be put down just to curiosity or initial hype. The second seasons have found wider audiences and viewership is growing. It shows just how deeply voyeuristic we are, as a society and culture. And that the way people with money and glamour live reflects the way they marry and follow up on the commitment. The Indian obsession with a big, fat, Instagram worthy marriage, is not going to fade away anytime soon.  Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives is about the day-to-day struggles and joys of Maheep Kapoor (wife of Sanjay Kapoor), Neelam Kothari (former actor and wife of Sameer Soni), Bhavna Pandey (wife of Chunky Pandey) and Seema Sajdeh (ex-wife of Sohail Khan).  Essentially their identity rests on the fact that they are wives or ex-wives, and their marriage is structural to their fame. Over the past decade, posing for pictures on social media in the company of movie stars and particularly under the halo of Gauri Khan, these ladies have gained currency as true-blue insiders of ‘Bollywood’. The series shows almost none of that, instead focusing on midlife angst of a universe where first world problems niggle at them. None are massive enough to cast an actual furrow or deepen a line around their well-maintained eyes, lips and faces. The truth about botox fillers, the painful and literally numbing process, along with allied procedures, make an appearance. There are crushes, cameos by Bollywood filmmakers and stars, including Bhavna’s daughter, Ananya Pandey. And there are tiffs and tussles, because, after all, they are wives- no wife can have a life free of arguments and battles. Overall this series does an efficient job of minimizing the day to day, routine struggles of running a home, bringing up kids and managing a social standard that most Indian women across social classes face. There are almost no exhausting chores in sight, beyond accompanying kids to photoshoots.  It’s ending- that of Ranveer Singh’s body being objectified in detail- has left many feeling distasteful. But in a series where an entire season has almost no element of feet touching ground reality for its four central characters, is it any surprise that silly lust is the final resolution? Although a male movie star stating that he loves being a piece of meat is not a salute to women’s liberation, at any level. All it is, is recognition of the bubble that can build around lives of people that exist on the fringes of the Hindi film industry.  How the Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives and Indian Matchmaking show Indias fascination with super wealthy lives Indian Matchmaking 2  But their ways of living and their personal choices have become a major topic of water cooler and coffee break conversations. Because that is the life, after all, that a whole new generation of consumerist India- urban and semi urban, even rural- deeply aspires to. Existing in a similar socio-economic space, Indian Matchmaking Season 2 turns the clock back on gender related progress significantly. Apart from formatted expectations of her clients, the most unsavory part of this series are the choices that Nonresident Indians make. They are almost stuck in a time warp when it comes to understanding marriage and companionship. Taparia often advises the young that she looks to get hitched- no one gets one hundred percent; you need to settle for 60 to seventy percent. Might not seem so nice, but it is commonly true. Marriage, like all partnerships, needs some adjustment. As for judging her statements, they need to be viewed in the light of her clientele. Amongst the super-rich, when they marry, a common truth prevails- wealth begets wealth; money begets money. This hasn’t changed since the Victorian age. Except for the rare aberration where love intervenes, marriage is still a merger of sorts for those that have countless zeros on their bank balance. The baffling part here are the exacting standards that these candidates seek from a partner. They want such an ideal, glossy, movie like wedding that sizing this down to today’s reality, where free will plays a strong role in everyone’s lives, is almost impossible. Perhaps that explains why no one seems to get married on this top matchmaker’s watch!  These shows that show lives most can only imagine having, have cast a spell on viewers like Karan Johar’s movies did about 15-20 years ago. The people at their centre feel unreal. But most of us love watching them anyway. And when it comes to us Indians, marriage is the biggest marker in a person’s life that still determines his/her identity at multiple levels.

      "body": "Ayan Mukerji’s Brahmastra and Puskhar–Gayathri’s Vikram Vedha are the two September  releases on which the beleaguered Bollywood industry has its hopes pinned. One can no longer make any logical prediction on what works and what doesn’t. But yes, Brahmastra is at least an attempt to give the audiences an entirely new theatre experience, something they haven’t seen, something that would stimulate their senses beyond the ordinary experience  provided by movies on the OTT platform.  Vikram Vedha, I am afraid, is nothing that the average Indian family would make an effort to go into the movie theatres to see. It is apparently an exact remake of the original. The cardinal error of doing a remake, besides the fact that a remake in principle is lazy filmmaking, unless you can add something radical to the original, is to have the same director do both the original and the remake.  This was the case recently with Jersey. The same director, Gowtam Naidu Tinnanuri, did both the Tamil and Hindi versions with the end result that the Tamil and Hindi versions, though  well-made, were interchangeable except for the actors.  Vikram Veda is helmed in Hindi  by the same co-directors, Pushkar–Gayathri. Sure, the actors are different. But the original 2017 film in Tamil, has been on OTT for two years now. It is  doubtful that audiences will make a rush for the remake just because an A-lister Hrithik Roshan and a B-lister Saif Ali Khan have replaced the outstanding duo of Madhavan and  Vijay Sethupathi in the original.  When Disney+Hotstar announced Cuttputlli, the remake  of the Tamil film Ratsasan as their big premiere for September 2, Zee5 pulled out a rabbit from its bag of tricks. They dubbed  Rakshasudu, the Telugu version of Ratsasan into Hindi, titled it Gumnam, and released it alongside Cuttputlli, on the same Friday.  While Disney-Hotstar acquired Cuttputlli for Rs 90 crores, Zee5 had to pay nothing for  Gumnam as Rakshasudu was already in their repertoire. With the recession claiming most, if not all theatre releases, it is time  for the film industry to exercise some prudence in their filmmaking. Acquiring remakes at exorbitant prices when the original is just a click away,  makes no sense.  This brings me back to Brahmastra. While its actual merits and demerits remain to be seen, it is at least original, not a remake and not copied from a Korean source. At least it stands a fighting chance to revive the lost glory of the Bollywood box-office.

      "body": "An artwork generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) bagged the first prize at a competition in the United States, triggering outrage on social media.  Jason Allen, the winner of the award and $300 cash prize, defended his art which won in the “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category.  “I’m not going to apologise for it… I won, and I didn’t break any rules,” the 39-year-old game designer told The New York Times (NYT).  Why has the controversy snowballed? Why are some against AI-generated art? Let’s examine the issue:  Théâtre D’opéra Spatial  Allen, who is the president of Colorado-based tabletop gaming company Incarnate Games, presented his work ‘Théâtre D’opéra Spatial’ or ‘Space Opera Theater’ and won the top prize at Colorado State Fair’s fine art competition.  “I won first place,” Allen who goes by Sincarnate had declared in a Discord post, reported Vice.  The piece was created using an online program called Midjourney, an invite-only AI tool, which transforms text into realistic graphics. “Users type a series of words in a message to Midjourney; the bot spits back an image seconds later,” NYT wrote about the AI software.  Explained The controversy surrounding the AIgenerated artwork that won US competition Midjourney, an invite-only AI tool, transforms text into realistic graphics. News18 (Representational Image)  Allen told Colorado Springs newspaper The Gazette that he was earlier skeptical about using AI for art. “But as more and more of it started crossing my path on social media, I started to take notice,” he said.  “I was really impressed with the quality and level of detail. I decided to give it a try,” Incarnate Games CEO added.  Allen believes artificial intelligence as an “artistic resource is likely here to stay” even if people do not like it.  He further said he is not yet done with his prize-winning artwork and will continue working on it. “Now that I know other people appreciate it the way that I do, I’m excited to complete the project in a much bigger way,” he told The Gazette.  AI-created artwork sparks controversy  The software Midjourney can create digital artwork in minutes that  a person would usually take hours or even days to produce.   Why are some objecting?  As per Indian Express, critics have objected to its use citing that transforming prompts into art is like “painting-by-numbers”, which means it is devoid of skill or real artistry.  As the news reached Twitter, netizens slammed Allen and the “death of artistry” saying it takes away from the hard work of human-made art.  “This is so gross. I can see how ai art can be beneficial, but claiming you’re an artist by generating one? Absolutely not,” a Twitter user wrote.  “The art created by AI is not the same as that created by man. I believe that at least it should be in a separate category and not overlap with ordinary art in any way. People like the person from the screenshot are just disgusting to me,” another user chimed.  “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold before our eyes — if creative jobs aren’t safe from machines, then even high-skilled jobs are in danger of becoming obsolete,” a third said on Twitter.  The rules of the competition  As per NYT, Colorado State Fair’s fine art competition allows any “artistic practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.”  Notably, the judges claimed they were unaware that Midjourney was an AI software, however, added that they would still have selected Allen’s artwork even if they knew, as they were seeking “how the art tells a story, how it invokes spirit”.",

      "body": "India may have a game-changer on its hands with the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approving Bharat Biotech’s intranasal COVID vaccine for restricted emergency use for those above 18.  “Big Boost to India’s Fight Against COVID-19! Bharat Biotech’s ChAd36-SARS-CoV-S COVID-19 (Chimpanzee Adenovirus Vectored) recombinant nasal vaccine approved by @CDSCO_INDIA_INF for primary immunization against COVID-19 in 18+ age group for restricted use in emergency situation,” Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted.  Mandaviya added that this step will further strengthen “our collective fight” against the pandemic. India has harnessed its science, research and development (R&D), and human resources in the fight against COVID-19 under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, he said.  “With the science-driven approach & Sabka Prayas, we will defeat COVID-19,” Mandaviya also said.  Let’s take a closer look at the vaccine:  How does it work?  As per News18, Bharat Biotech’s nasal vaccine uses a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver a harmless copy of the coronavirus spike protein to the lining of the nose.  As per Hindustan Times, the theory behind delivering the vaccine through intranasal route is that both influenza and COVID-19 follow the same pattern of infection – nose and mouth route into the lungs.  That is why having mucosal immunity is important and the vaccine will also use the same nasal (drop) route, as per the report.  It has been specifically formulated to allow intranasal delivery and has been developed in partnership with Washington University St Louis, which had designed and developed the recombinant adenoviral vectored constructs and evaluated them in preclinical studies for efficacy, as per the report.  The trial sites included All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi and Patna (Bihar), Aatman Hopsital, Ahmedabad (Gujarat), PGIMS, Rohtak (Haryana), and Prakhar Hospital, Kanpur, and Rana Hospital, Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), as per Hindustan Times.  What are its advantages?  Hindustan Times quoted Bharat Biotech as saying that as the vaccine is easy to administer as it is non-invasive and does not require trained health care workers.  It further eliminates needle-associated risks such as injuries and infections, has higher compliance and is scalable as far as manufacturing is concerned.  News18 quoted an article published by Gavi the Vaccine Alliance as noting other advantages including the fact that the sprays don’t need to be refrigerated and don’t need to be administered by health professionals.  “People would be able to self-administer them at home,” the article says, adding “they are likely to be more popular for the millions of people who don’t like needles”.  What has company said?  The Hyderabad-based firm completed clinical trials of the nasal vaccine with about 4,000 volunteers and there is no side effect or adverse reaction reported so far, company sources said.",

      "body": "The monsoon mayhem continues in Karnataka and Kerala. And it’s worrisome in more ways than one. In the first week of September, the withdrawal of the monsoon commences. However, that seems unlikely right now.  Torrential rains continue to batter the southern states, causing large-scale devastation and throwing life out of gear. But what’s the reason behind the untimely downpour? We explain.  Devastation in Bengaluru, southern Karnataka  The southern districts of Karnataka have witnessed a wet season since June. This year, the state has recorded 894.7 mm of rainfall, which is an excess of 33 per.  Bengaluru has been the worst hit. In August, the IT capital received 184.4 mm of rainfall, the highest in four years. The last month has been the second wettest August for the city, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)  Some parts of Karnataka have witnessed non-stop rain for over a week.  Also read: Cry Me a River: Why Bengaluru suffers from flooding repeatedly  Now overnight downpour has brought the capital city to a standstill. Around 430 houses have been completely damaged in the floods and 2,188 others have suffered partial damage. About 225 km of roads, bridges, culverts and electric poles have also been damaged. There have been power cuts in certain parts of Bengaluru.  On Tuesday, a 23-year-old woman died in the Siddapura area near Marathahalli near Bengaluru. After her two-wheeler broke down on a waterlogged road, she tried to hold an electric pole and was electrocuted.  Floating cars, submerged villas  Boats and tractors were deployed in certain parts of Bengaluru like Yemalur, Rainbow Drive layout, Sunny Brooks Layout, Marathahalli that were underwater. “Water has not receded, as there was rain once again last night (Monday), in fact, I feel it has increased. I have to go to the office, kids have schools, and I somehow used a tractor today. Request the government and authorities to do something and restore normalcy,” an office goer told News18.   Cars were seen floating in waterlogged Basvanagar and luxury villas were completely flooded with rescue ops underway.  Traffic woes in the city are an everyday occurrence but the rains have made the snarls even worst. On Tuesday, a Bengaluru airport spokesperson said that flights have been slightly delayed because of bad weather conditions.   The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) warned of water supply disruption in several areas of the city on Monday and Tuesday. A pumphouse in Mandya, which has been flooded, is being cleaned.  Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said that 8,000 borewells would supply water to affected areas and in areas with no borewells, water would be supplied through tankers.  Schools and colleges have declared a holiday because of waterlogging.  Isnt it time for monsoon to retreat The manic rainfall in Karnataka Kerala explained The waterlogging in Bengaluru has thrown light on the fallout of unplanned urbanisation. PTI  Bommai has said the state government has decided to release Rs 300 crore to tackle the emergency in the city. Another Rs 300 crore will be used to tackle the rain and flood situation in other parts of the state.  This is the second time in a week that the IT hub has witnessed massive flooding, leading to outrage among residents over alleged misgovernance. Rampant corruption, unplanned construction, and poor engineering have made led the city to crumble. The Bengaluru civic body has identified encroachment on 500 storm water drains, which is leaving it waterlogged time and again.   The Gadag district in Karnataka, which has been devastated by rain, received 122.3 mm of rainfall on Monday. More rain is expected on Tuesday.  Heavy rain is also likely to occur at isolated places in Bagalkote, Dharwad, Haveri, Koppal, Raichur and Vijayapura districts. These districts have been put on yellow alert by the IMD, reports News18.  Isnt it time for monsoon to retreat The manic rainfall in Karnataka Kerala explained Boats are used to rescue people stranded because of the flooding in Bengaluru. Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said that the authorities are working round the clock to keep the city afloat. PTI  Red alert, flash floods in Kerala  While three months of the monsoon are over, Kerala’s rainfall reached the “normal” mark only recently. But the past few days, have seen continuous rainfall in the state.   The IMD has issued a red alert for Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, and Idukki districts for Tuesday and an orange alert for Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Ernakulam districts.  An orange alert has also been issued for Idukki, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, and Kannur with predictions of heavy rain on Tuesday, a day before Onam.  Two persons, including an eight-year-old, lost their lives after being swept away in flash floods at Mankayam waterfall near the capital city, Thiruvananthapuram. The flash flood occurred on Sunday and police said that a group of 10 people had visited the area.  Other states put on alert  The IMD has forecast heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and lightning in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh on 8 and 9 September. Meanwhile, Lakshadweep, Telangana and coastal Andhra Pradesh are also expected to witness “very heavy rainfall” on September 7 and 9.  Isnt it time for monsoon to retreat The manic rainfall in Karnataka Kerala explained Firefighters help an elderly woman move to a safer area after heavy rainfall in Bengaluru. Life for many in the city is disrupted after torrential rains. AP  The reasons for the manic monsoon  Dr Geeta Agnihotri, head of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Bengaluru, told indiatoday.in that the very heavy rains in Bengaluru city were because of the shear zone that had formed. “It’s a normal occurrence during monsoons just as the formation of troughs, circulations, and low-pressure regions that drive monsoonal rains,” she said.  A shear zone is a monsoon weather feature that is an area filled with opposing winds concentrating heavy rain in that zone, the report says.  The position of the monsoon trough is favouring rainfall in Karnataka and Kerala. It is a low-pressure area, which is a semi-permanent feature of the circulation of monsoon. When the trough migrates southward, it results in a heavy monsoon.  In contrast, the northward migration of this trough leads to a break in monsoon conditions over a major part of India and heavy rains along the foothills of the Himalayas and sometimes floods in the Brahmaputra river, according to IMD.

      "body": "Next time you walk down the road from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Delhi, it won’t be the iconic Rajpath that you have trailed, but the Kartavya Path (Path of Duty).  The Narendra Modi government has decided to rename the iconic stretch and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has convened a special meeting on 7 September where the proposal will be placed before the council.The move comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the entire stretch, which has been renovated under his government’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project. Under the project, Rajpath will have state-wise food stalls, red granite walkways with greenery all around, vending zones, parking lots and round-the-clock security. But people would miss only one thing — food will not be allowed on the lawns from India Gate to Man Singh Road.  The stretch will open for the public after 20 months. On the day of the inauguration, visitors will not be allowed on the stretch from the India Gate to Man Singh Road, but they can use the remaining part. From 9 September, the entire stretch will be thrown open to the public.  The renaming of Rajpath to Kartavya Path is part of the Modi government’s drive to rid the country of its colonial past. In his recent Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said stressed on the abolition of symbols relating to colonial mindset. “We have to give up the colonial-era mentality. Instead, we must rely on our capabilities,” he had said.  Rajpath’s colonial past  Rajpath — the ceremonial boulevard that runs from Rashtrapati Bhawan all the way down to Vijay Chowk and India Gate, and ends at the 16th century fort, Purana Qila — was named by the British as ‘Kingsway’ in honour of King George V who visited this new city during the Delhi Durbar of 1911 and proclaimed the shift of the capital from Calcutta to the erstwhile centre of Mughal power.  Like much of Central Delhi, Rajpath was designed by British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. It was set up to offer an uninterrupted view of the new city from the Rashtrapati Bhavan, which was the Viceroy’s palace at the time and today serves as the official residence of the President of India.  Following the independence of India, the road was given its Hindi name, ‘Rajpath’, in place of its English designation. This represents a mere translation more than a substantial renaming, since ‘Rajpath’ in Hindi is broadly analogous in meaning to ‘King’sway’.   Today, Rajpath is not only synonymous with the Republic Day parade, but has also become a symbol of resistance. The site has seen massive protests — from agitations demanding justice after the 2012 Delhi gang-rape to the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in 2021.  Rajpath to make way for Kartavya Path How India is stepping away from its colonial past Considered the most popular public space in Delhi, the stretch has been redeveloped with red granite walkways spread around 1.1 lakh square metre with greenery all around. PIB  Shedding colonial baggage  Over the past few years, the Narendra Modi-led government has been slowly steering India away from the vestiges of the British rule.  Earlier, the Centre repealed more than 1,500 old and obsolete laws, most of which were remnants of the British era.  During an April event, speaking to civil servants, Prime Minister Modi had said, “I have directed the cabinet secretary to take charge of freeing citizens and the country from compliance burdens. The country is completing 75 years of independence. Why do we need to keep the citizens occupied in the shackles of compliance?”  Citing the example of a law mandating imprisonment for the offence of not white-washing toilets at factories every six months, the prime minister said that the law should not be looking to send citizens to jail for trivial issues, reports News18.  Another example of India moving away from India’s colonial past was the decision to replace the Abide with me hymn at the Beating Retreat Ceremony during the Republic Day celebrations with Kavi Pradeep’s Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon. The Beating Retreat ceremony had earlier also seen the introduction of classical instruments such as sitar, santoor, and the tabla.  The prime minister also unveiled a hologram statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate. This hologram is to be later replaced with the statue of Netaji. The statue would be unveiled in the same place to mark the year-long celebration of the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. This has been done at the canopy where a statue of King George V had stood till its removal in 1968.  Rajpath to make way for Kartavya Path How India is stepping away from its colonial past The hologram of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at the canopy where a statue of King George V stood. The hologram will make way for a statue later. PTI  In 2017, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented the Budget on 1 February — in a break from the past where the Budget was announced on the last day of February. The Rail Budget was also merged with the Union Budget after it had been presented separately for 92 years, in yet another departure from British-era practices.  In 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also opted for the traditional bahi khata rather than the briefcase tradition — a tradition that comes from United Kingdom from the 18th century. The first budget box was designed in 1860 for the Chancellor of the UK back then, William Ewart Gladstone.  Most recently, while commissioning the INS Vikrant, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also unveiled a new naval ensign doing away with the Saint George’s Cross and replacing it with a design inspired by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.  The new ensign consists of the national flag in the upper left canton, and a navy blue-gold octagon at the centre of the fly. A blue octagonal shape with the national emblem sits atop an anchor, superimposed on a shield.  Below the shield, within the octagon, is inscribed the motto of the Indian Navy “Sam No Varunah” (a prayer to the God of the sea, Varuna).  Speaking at the event, Prime Minister Modi had said, “Till now the identity of slavery remained on the flag of Indian Navy. But from today onwards, inspired by Chhatrapati Shivaji, the new navy flag will fly in the sea and in the sky.”  With inputs from agencies  Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

      "body": "Washington: Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has introduced a standalone bill in the US House of Representatives seeking a waiver to India against the punitive CAATSA sanctions, asserting that it is in the best interests of both countries to deter “aggressors” in light of Russia and China’s close ties.  The Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) is a tough US law that authorises the US administration to impose sanctions on countries that purchase major defence hardware from Russia in response to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections.  The resolution, which has also been endorsed by Congressman Brad Sherman and David Schweikert along with Khanna, has been sent to the House Foreign Affairs Committee for necessary action.  While India faces immediate needs to maintain its heavily Russian-built weapons systems, a waiver to sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act during this transition period is in the best interests of the United States and the United States-India defence partnership to deter aggressors in light of Russia and China’s close partnership, it said.  A similar legislative amendment to the National Defense Authorisation Act (NDAA) was introduced by Khanna, a Democrat, this summer and it was passed by the House with bipartisan support.  “I first introduced this as an amendment to the National Defense Authorisation Act and now I am proud to introduce it as a standalone bill to continue to build momentum and support for it. It is necessary for us to pass this in order to strengthen the relationship between the US and India and deter aggressors like China,” Khanna told PTI.  The resolution asserts that India faces immediate and serious regional border threats from China, with continued military aggression by the government of China along the India-China border.  While India has started importing the S-400 missile defence system from Russia, US President Joe Biden is yet to take a call on CAATSA waiver sanctions. Under the existing laws, the president can give a national interest waiver to countries.  Khanna said that this is a strong bill to affirm the US and India defence partnership.  Observing that India relies on Russian-built weapons for its national defence, the resolution says that the United States should take additional steps to encourage India to accelerate India’s transition off Russian-built weapons and defence systems while strongly supporting India’s immediate defence needs.  It is the sense of Congress that a strong United States-India defence partnership, rooted in shared democratic values, is critical in order to advance United States interests in the Indo-Pacific region, it said.  This partnership between the world’s oldest and largest democracies is critical and must continue to be strengthened in response to increasing threats in the Indo-Pacific regions, sending an unequivocal signal that sovereignty and international law must be respected, it added.  CAATSA law was brought in 2017 and provides for punitive actions by the US government against any country engaged in transactions with the Russian defence and intelligence sectors.  In October 2018, India signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, despite a warning from the then-Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions. The S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.  The US has already imposed sanctions on Turkey under the CAATSA for the purchase of a batch of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia.  According to the resolution, Congress finds that the United States-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (ICET) is a welcome and essential step to developing closer partnerships between governments, academia, and industry in the United States and India to address the latest advances in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, aerospace, and semiconductor manufacturing.  Such collaborations between engineers and computer scientists are vital to help ensure that the United States and India, as well as other democracies around the world, foster innovation and facilitate technological advances which continue to far outpace Russian and Chinese technology, according to the resolution.
